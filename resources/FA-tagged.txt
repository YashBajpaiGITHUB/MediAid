TITLE OF CHAPTER
PREFACE 
 
First aid training is a low cost, but highly effective strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality.  
With the help of Belgian Red Cross Centre for Evidence Practice (CEBaP), Belgian Red Cross-
Flanders and a multi-disciplinary expert panel, Indian Red Cross Society prepared the 
evidence-based Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG) in 2014 which were used to update the sixth 
edition of first aid Manual prepared for the general public by the St. John Ambulance (India) 
and the Indian Red Cross Society. 
First aid has been practised in the world since antiquity. There is enough evidence that it was 
used to give relief to the injured and sick persons in wars and calamities in India since the times 
of Mahabarata. The use of first aid techniques expanded and improved with time, but it got 
the real fillip when the Red Cross Movement started in the world about 150 years ago. 
Consequently, The Indian Red Cross Society was established in 1920 through an Act of the 
Parliament. Until then, the St. John Ambulance carried out Red Cross work in addition to its 
normal activities. 
To provide the right and effective help before a trained health worker is available or the victim 
reaches a health facility, it needs to be given by the laypersons who happen to be present 
wherever a person suffers from an injury or illness. This will only be possible when a large number 
of laypeople are trained in evidence-based first aid techniques. Presently, about 6 lakh persons 
are trained in India every year in the basic first aid. The number looks impressive, but is not 
adequate considering the huge population and vast area not having good communication 
facilities. 
This seventh edition of the Indian First Aid Manual (IFAM) has several new and updated features. 
A brief on anatomy and physiology has been provided on each system. The chapter on cardio 
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been completely revised. More emphasis has been put on 
chest compression to ensure improvement in the blood supply to heart and brain, and use of 
direct pressure to the site of # BLEEDING bleeding to control further # BLEEDING bleeding. A chapter on handwashing 
has been added to prevent the transmission of infections between the victim and first aiders. 
Guidelines related to # SNAKE_BITE snake bites have been totally revised considering the after effects of 
tourniquet binding. Useful guidelines have been added for important public health problems 
such as diarrhoea, fever, diabetes, emergency childbirth etc. which still claim many lives. 
I hope, the new Manual will be immensely useful for the laypersons as well as healthcare 
workers to understand the evidence-based techniques of first aid which are becoming more 
and more crucial in saving life in this era when the country is facing an epidemic of roadside 
accidents.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
USING THIS MANUAL 
This manual is offered by the Indian Red Cross Society and the St John Ambulance Association 
India for use by their members and the general public. Being laymen in the field of medicine, 
it is expected that they will practice the basic principles of first aid and render such aid needed 
by the casualty (casualties) till medical aid arrives or the person(s) has (have) been transported 
to the hospital. The basic characteristic of this manual is to make the layman fully competent 
practically in the subject. 
The first aid guidelines in this manual have been based on the latest available and accessible 
scientific and medical knowledge. In 2014, a team of Indian medical and first aid specialists 
publicised the Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG). These guidelines are developed using a 
rigorous and transparent methodology to overcome potential biases; are based on extensive 
research, data analysis and reviews; and are specifically adapted to be implemented within 
the Indian context.  These guidelines are further complemented by the 2015 guidelines on 
resuscitation and first aid as published by International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation 
(ILCOR) and the American Heart Association (AHA). The editorial board reviewed the 
applicability of available first aid guidelines into the specific Indian context and rephrased or 
adapted them accordingly. For interventions were neither IFAG nor international first aid 
guidelines existed, or in case sufficient or scientifically evidence was not available, the editorial 
board decided to include the commonly applied first aid practices.  
In the first chapter, this manual specifies in detail what “first aid” is about and how to deal with 
an emergency. It further includes basic first aid techniques the first aider should master, i.e. 
observing vital signs and consciousness; cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); recovery 
position, the first assessment of a casualty; and handwashing. 
The subsequent chapters describe a more in-depth first aid approach and techniques.  
The structure of these chapters is: 
 
Each chapter begins with a short overview of the anatomy and physiology.  
 
For specific situation or condition, a list of signs and symptoms a lay person may 
observe and recognize are included in the section ‘What do I see and enquire?’ 
 
This section is immediately followed by ‘What do I do?’ listing a sequence of first 
aid guidelines and techniques appropriate for that situation or condition. 
Drawings support the student/reader in understanding specific positions, 
techniques or signs.  
 
The list of guidelines and techniques is completed with a section on ‘When to 
refer the casualty to a healthcare facility?’  
Please note all casualties should best consult a medical caregiver in all cases. If 
(urgent) patient transport is required, this is indicated by         .   
If the casualty normally does not require organized (ambulance) transport for 
further treatment, it is marked with the sign      .  
However, depending on the specific situation, condition of the person and 
severity of the injury or sickness, (ambulance) transport or even urgent transport 
might be required: the first aider needs to consider all elements on when and 
how a casualty needs to seek further medical help. In case of doubt, it is always 
better to arrange (urgent) transport to the healthcare facility for further medical 
treatment. 
Important remarks are highlighted in grey text box and preceded with a          
sign. Supplemental information is marked with       and printed in a smaller font.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
The contents of a first aid box are listed at the last few pages of the manual. 
Throughout the manual we opted to use the terms ‘injured person’, ‘casualty’ or simply ‘the 
person’ as a person who got injured or even killed by some event. If the reason is a disease or 
illness, the term ‘sick person’ is used. 
The guidelines and instructions are intended to be applied on both male and female 
casualties. To make the reading easier, and instead of writing ‘he/she’, we opted to use the 
pronoun ‘he’ meaning that the guideline or instruction is applicable both for male and female 
victims. Only if the intervention is specifically applicable to females, we use ‘she’ in the 
instructions.  
This manual is limited in describing the guidelines, interventions and techniques in words and 
pictures only. To acquire a practical knowledge, it is important to practice the specific 
techniques, i.e. basic first aid techniques e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), how to put 
a person into recovery position, etc. First aid course organized by the Indian Red Cross Society 
and the St John Ambulance Association India are ideal opportunities in achieving a clear 
insight in the techniques and allows to exercise the theory into practice via simulation and on 
dummies. 
It is advised the trained first aider to refresh their first aid knowledge by reviewing the guidelines 
and techniques regularly in this manual and to practice them very frequently.  
The medical science is constantly in evolution. Newer scientific insights might have an influence 
on the approach of casualties by lay people and on the first aid guidelines and techniques. 
This manual is scheduled to be reviewed and updated every five years; the next review is 
scheduled in 2021.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
A.1 
AIMS OF FIRST AID  
First aid is the first assistance or treatment given to a casualty or a sick person for any injury or 
sudden illness before the arrival of an ambulance, the arrival of a qualified paramedical or 
medical person or before arriving at a facility that can provide professional medical care.  
As a consequence of disaster or civil strife people suffer injuries which requires urgent care and 
transportation to the nearest healthcare facility. 
A.1.1 
AIMS OF FIRST AID 
The aims of first aid are: 
 
to preserve life, 
 
to prevent the worsening of one’s medical condition, 
 
to promote recovery, and 
 
to help to ensure safe transportation to the nearest healthcare facility. 
A.1.2 
THE FIRST AIDER 
A first aider is the term describing any person who has received a certificate from an authorised 
training body indicating that he or she is qualified to render first aid.  
First aid certifications issued by St. John Ambulance Association and the Indian Red Cross 
Society are awarded to candidates who have attended a course of theoretical and practical 
work and who have passed a professionally supervised examination.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
A.2 
FIRST AID AND THE LAW 
A.2.1 
INDIAN GOOD SAMARITAN PROTECTION GUIDELINES 
A Good Samaritan in legal terms refers to “someone who renders aid in an emergency to an 
injured person on a voluntary basis”.  
The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has published the Indian Good Samaritan and 
Bystanders Protection Guidelines in The Gazette of India in May 2015 (Notification No 
25035/101/2014-RS dated 12 May 2015). The guidelines are to be followed by hospitals, police 
and other authorities for the protection of Good Samaritans. 
Following guidelines are included (sub-selection of the guidelines): 
1. A bystander or Good Samaritan, including an eyewitness of a road accident may 
take an injured to the nearest hospital and should be allowed to leave immediately. 
The eyewitness has to provide his address. No questions are to be asked. 
2. The bystander or Good Samaritan shall not be liable for any civil and criminal 
liability. 
3. A bystander or Good Samaritan who makes a phone call to inform the police or 
emergency services for the person lying injured on the road cannot be compelled 
to give his name or personal details on the phone or in person. The disclosure of 
contact details of the Good Samaritan is to be voluntary. 
4. The lack of response by a (medical) doctor in an emergency pertaining to road 
accidents (where he is expected to provide care) shall constitute ‘Professional 
Misconduct’. 
A.2.2 
DUTY OF GIVING CARE 
Usually, if a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person 
giving the aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.  
In relation to the “duty of giving care”, there is currently (2015) no legal obligation for first aiders 
to provide first aid in a general public context, not unless it's part of a job description. First aid 
officers in workplaces and school teachers have a duty of care. 
Once a first aider begins to provide first aid, a duty of care is established and the first aider then 
has an obligation to fulfil the duty of care.  
If a road user is involved in an accident, there is a legal requirement to stay at the scene, assist 
the injured and report the incident to the police. 
Not fulfilling a duty of giving care leaves the first aider open to questions of negligence. Whilst 
there is no law that forces anyone to treat a casualty this does not mean that one can simply 
leave a casualty who you know is in danger.  To do so may make you liable through your 
omission to act.   If you are not happy to provide first aid there are several things you can and 
should do including (but not limited to):  
 
inform someone else, such as the police or the emergency services; 
 
make the area around the casualty safe for yourself, others and the casualty; 
 
monitor the casualty and/or find out what happened; and 
 
comfort the casualty. 


  
17 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
A.2.3 
CONSENT OF THE PERSON IN NEED 
A conscious person has the right to either refuse or accept care. If the person is conscious, you 
must ask for his consent before commencing any first aid. If he refuses your help, stay nearby 
and call the police and emergency services, who can then deal with the situation. 
If the person is under 18, it is best to obtain consent from his parent or guardian if they are 
present. If they refuse your help, stay nearby and call the police and the emergency services, 
who can then deal with the situation. 
If the person is # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious or unable to formally consent, his consent is inferred and you can 
then give the necessary first aid. 
A.2.4 
PRIVACY 
In any first aid situation, the first aider must take steps to assist the person to maintain personal 
privacy. This means things like, keeping crowds away, putting up a screen if necessary, and 
covering any exposed body parts with blankets, or sheets, if available. 
The first aider also needs to take steps to maintain confidentiality. This means not talking about 
the incident to other people, or answering questions from the media, unless you have 
permission from the person involved in the accident. 
A.2.5 
NEGLIGENCE  
If a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person giving 
the aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.  
Not fulfilling, or breaking a duty of care leaves the first aider open to questions of negligence.  
It is unlikely that a first aider would be sued as long as not practiced outside the parameters of 
the techniques taught at the first aid training.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
A.3 
DEALING WITH AN EMERGENCY 
Emergency situations vary greatly but there are four main steps that always apply: 
1. Make the area safe. 
2. Evaluate the injured person’s condition. 
3. Seek help. 
4. Give first aid. 
A.3.1 
STEP 1: MAKE THE AREA SAFE 
Your own safety should always come first.  
As a first aider, you should: 
 
try to find out what has just happened; 
 
check for any danger: is there a threat from traffic, fire, electricity cables, etc.; 
 
never approach the scene of an accident if you are putting yourself in danger; 
 
do your best to protect both the injured person(s) and other people on the scene; 
 
be aware that the property of the injured person is at risk. Theft can occur. So mind 
your safety, and 
 
seek police or emergency help if an accident scene is unsafe and you cannot offer 
help without putting yourself in danger. 
An important part of safety also includes washing your hands and wearing gloves or 
a protection when coming in contact with the injured or sick person’s blood or body 
fluids.  
In case of road accidents, as a first aider, you should: 
 
always follow the traffic rules; 
 
ask other people to warn traffic about the event; 
 
if possible, place a warning sign at a good distance, at least 30 meters to either side 
of the accident, to warn traffic. Do not forget to remove the warning signs 
afterwards; 
 
seek help from the police or emergency services; 
 
not allow anybody to smoke near an accident site; 
 
switch off the engine of every car involved in the accident; and 


  
19 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
try to apply the handbrake of vehicles involved in the accident to prevent them 
from moving. You can also put something against the tyres to prevent rolling. 
As a general rule, the injured person should not be moved from the scene of an accident. 
Any movement may make the injury worse if there has been a head, neck, back, and leg or 
arm injury. 
Only move injured people if: 
 
the injured person is in more danger if he is left there, 
 
the situation cannot be made safe, 
 
medical help will not arrive soon, and 
 
you can do so without putting yourself in danger. 
A.3.2 
STEP 2: EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF THE SICK OR INJURED PERSON 
If it is safe, you can evaluate the sick or injured person’s condition. Always check that he is 
conscious and breathing normally. Situations in which consciousness or breathing are 
impaired are often life threatening.  
Bleeding can also happen inside the body and can be life-threatening although the loss of 
blood is not seen.  
Techniques of resuscitation (CPR), the recovery position, etc. are explained in this manual. 
A.3.3 
STEP 3: SEEK HELP 
 
Once you have evaluated the sick or injured person’s condition you can decide if help is 
needed urgently. 
If help is needed, ask a bystander to call for help. Ask him to come back and confirm that help 
is underway. 
If you call for help, be prepared to have the following information available: 


  
20 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
the location where the help is required (address, street, specific reference points, 
location;  if in a building: floor, room); 
 
the telephone or mobile number you are calling from; 
 
the nature of the problem; 
 
what happened (car accident, fall, sudden illness, explosion, …); 
 
how many injured;  
 
nature of the injuries (if you know); 
 
what type of help is needed: 
 ambulance, 
 police, 
 fire brigade, or 
 other services; 
 and any other information that might help. 
You might be asked to give your name. Always stay calm and answer their questions calmly. 
The call takers are professionals and will give you further guidance. 
If an ambulance can be obtained in a short time, it is best to call for one and use it to 
transport the injured or sick person to the healthcare facility. An ambulance is the best way 
to transport ill or injured persons, but they are not always and everywhere quickly available. 
You can always ask the police for help. 
If no help is available, you will have to arrange transport yourself (in a van, a truck, a car, an 
auto-rickshaw, a motorbike, a scooter, a bike-rickshaw, a bike...). Always move the sick or 
injured person with great care. 
A.3.4 
STEP 4: PROVIDE FIRST AID 
Give first aid in accordance with the instructions given in the following chapters in this manual. 
When providing first aid, try to protect an ill or injured person from cold and heat. 
Do not give anything to eat or drink to a person who is: 
 
severely injured, 
 
feeling nausea, 
 
becoming sleepy, or  
 
falling # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious. 
In fact, as a general principle, the rule is not to give a casualty anything to drink or eat. 
Important exceptions include hypothermia (low body temperature), hypoglycaemic 
# SHOCK shock (low blood sugar in a diabetes patient), diarrhoea and fever leading to 
dehydration and in case of heat exhaustion or heatstroke.  The details can be reviewed 
in the specific chapters on these conditions. 
Be aware that experiencing an emergency situation is a very stressful experience for the 
injured or sick person. 


  
21 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
To support him through the ordeal, follow these simple tips: 
 
tell the sick or injured person your name, explain how you are going to help him and 
reassure him. This will help to relax him;

WHEN CAN I STOP PROVIDING FIRST AID? 
The question arises when your first aid ‘duty’ comes to an end?  
Within first aid, CPR is a lifesaving activity. But when you can stop giving CPR? There are four 
reasons allowing you to stop CPR: 
 
you see a sign of life, such as breathing; 
 
someone trained in first aid or a medical professional takes over;  
 
you are too exhausted to continue; or  
 
the scene becomes unsafe for you to continue.

A.4 
STRESS WHEN GIVING FIRST AID 
It is only normal to feel stress if you are suddenly faced with the need to give first aid in a real 
emergency.  
Try to bring your emotions under control before you proceed. You may take some time to 
stand back from the situation and regain your calm. Do not set about the task too hastily and 
do not under any circumstances place your own safety at risk. 
It is not always easy to process a traumatic event emotionally. It is not unusual for first aiders to 
experience difficulty when working through their emotions afterwards. Talk to your friends, 
family, fellow first aiders or someone else. If you are still worried, talk to a professional and seek 
counselling.

A.5 
RESUSCITATION (BASIC CPR) 
Reviving someone who is # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious and/or not breathing or not breathing normally is called 
resuscitation.  
If the victim is not breathing or is not breathing normally, any source of suffocation should be 
removed and resuscitation is to be started. 
Chest compressions with or without rescue breathings are performed by an individual during 
cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in an attempt to restore spontaneous circulation.  
For untrained or minimally trained first aid providers treating an adult victim, compression-only 
CPR is recommended.  These chest compressions ensure a small but crucial supply of blood to 
the heart and brain.  
For formally trained first aid providers (and professionals) treating an adult victim, compression 
with breaths is recommended. If the trained first aid provider is unable or unwilling, or in any 
other circumstance, compression-only CPR may be substituted for compression with breaths. 
For babies and children under one year, compressions with breaths are always recommended. 
A.5.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
In case of a cardiac arrest (heart stops functioning) you might notice the following signs: 
 
sudden collapse, 
 
loss of consciousness, 
 
no breathing, 
 
no pulse (however this is not always easy for laypeople to confirm). 
A.5.1.1 
HOW TO OBSERVE RESPONSIVENESS AND CONSCIOUSNESS? 
Unconsciousness occurs when a person is suddenly unable to respond to stimuli like sound or 
pain, and appears to be asleep. A person may be # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious for a few seconds (as is the 
case with fainting) or for longer periods of time.   
People who become # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious do not respond to loud sounds or shaking. They may even 
stop breathing or their pulse may become faint. This calls for immediate emergency attention. 
The sooner the person receives emergency first aid, the better it is. 
The AVPU scale (an acronym from "alert, voice, pain, unresponsiveness") is a system by which 
a first aider can measure and record a patient's responsiveness, indicating the level of 
consciousness. It is based on the casualty’s eye opening, verbal and movement (motor) 
responses.  
The AVPU scale has only four possible outcomes: 
 
A – Alert.  
The person is fully awake (although not necessarily oriented). The person will spontaneously 
open eyes, will respond to voice (although may be confused) and will have bodily motor 
function. 
 
 


  
24 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
V – Responding to voice. 
The person makes some kind of response when you talk to him. It could be opening his 
eyes, responding to your questions or initiating a move. These responses could be as little 
as a grunt, moan, or slight movement of a limb when prompted by the voice of the rescuer. 
 
P – Responding to pain. 
The patient makes a response of any kind on the application of pain stimulus, such as a 
central pain stimulus like a  rub on his breastbone or a peripheral stimulus such as squeezing 
his fingers.  
Patients with some level of consciousness (a fully conscious patient would not require any 
pain stimulus) may respond by using their voice, moving their eyes, or moving part of their 
body (including abnormal posturing). 
 
U - Unresponsiveness also noted as 'Unconsciousness'. 
This outcome is recorded if the patient does not give any eye, voice or motor response to 
voice or pain. 
To check a person’s responsiveness/consciousness state check the following: 
1. A person who looks around, speaks, responds clearly to questions, feels touch and 
moves or walks around, is considered alert (A). 
2. The person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions: 
 
“What is your name?” 
 
“Where do you live?” 
 
“How old are you?” 
The person responds to simple commands: 
 
“Squeeze my hand.” 
 
“Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.” 
If the person responds, he is responsive to voice (V). 
3. If there is still no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves. 
  If the person responds to pain, he is responsive to pain (P) 
If the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious state (U).  
Note that a person might only partially respond to the stimuli you provide (sound, touch, 
pain) and might be in an in-between (groggy) state. 


  
25 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Checking if a casualty is conscious or # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious should only take a few seconds and 
should not delay checking for the breathing. 
More information on # UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness is given in the respective chapter. 
A.5.1.2 
HOW TO OBSERVE THE BREATHING? 
The airway may be narrowed or blocked making breathing noisy or impossible. Reasons for 
blockage may be: 
 
Loss of muscular control in the throat may allow the tongue to sag back and block 
the air passage. 
 
When the reflexes are impaired, saliva may lie in the back of the throat, blocking 
the airway. 
 
Any foreign body in the throat may block the air passage e.g. vomit, blood, 
dentures etc.  
It is essential to establish a clear airway immediately. Unless you can clearly see that 
the person is breathing normally, an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious person must be turned onto his back 
to unblock the breathing passage and to check for breathing. Unblocking the 
breathing passage takes priority over concerns about a potential spinal injury. 
To observe the breathing do following: 
1. If the person is # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious and is not on his back, turn him on to his back.  
2. Kneel beside the casualty. 
3. Lift the chin forwards with the index and middle fingers of one hand while pressing 
the forehead backwards with the palm of the other hand. This manoeuvre will lift 
the tongue forward and clear the airways. 
 
4. Observe breathing by listening, feeling and looking 
5. After opening the victim's airway, check to see if the victim is breathing.  
To do this, place your cheek in front of the victim's mouth (about 3-5 cm away) while 
looking down his chest (towards his feet).  
If desired, you can also gently place a hand on the center of the victim's chest. This 
allows you to observe whether the victim is breathing in the following ways: 
a. look for chest/abdominal movement, 
b. listen to breathing sounds, 
c. feel the air coming out of the nose or mouth. 


  
26 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
 
In the first minutes after cardiac arrest it often appears as if the person is trying to 
breathe. It can appear as if the person is barely breathing or is taking infrequent 
noisy gasps. It is important not to confuse this with normal breathing and you should 
start resuscitation immediately. 
 
6. If the casualty’s chest still fails to rise, first assume that the airway is not fully open. 
Once the airway is cleared the casualty may begin breathing spontaneously.  
Else, clear the airway by removing any visible item that is blocking the airway: 
a. Hook your first two fingers covered with clean cloth/gloves. 
b. Sweep round inside the mouth/ throat.  
c. Check again the breathing. 
One should not spend time searching for hidden obstructions. Care should be 
taken not to push any object further down the throat. 
 
Be careful: do not put your fingers in somebody’s closed mouth. 
More information on the breathing can be found in the respective chapter. 
A.5.1.3 
HOW TO OBSERVE THE PULSE? 
Feeling the pulse is not always easy. Feeling the pulse during an emergency at the wrist is often 
unreliable. 
 
The pulse can be felt by placing the finger tips gently on the voice box and sliding them down 
into the hollow between the voice box and the adjoining muscle.  


  
27 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Do not loose time trying to locate and feel the pulse. The current resuscitation guidelines for 
laypeople direct that resuscitation (CPR) is to be started when the person is not breathing or 
not breathing normally and does not require to check the pulse. 
More information on the pulse can be found in the respective chapter.

RESUSCITATION OF A PERSON WHO IS NOT BREATHING OR NOT BREATHING 
NORMALLY 
A.5.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP 
1. Make sure there is no danger to you, the person who needs help and bystanders 
before giving help.  
2. The person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave 
the person unattended.  Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport 
to the nearest healthcare facility.  Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has 
been secured. 
A.5.2.2 
SECURE AN OPEN AIRWAY 
The airway may be narrowed or blocked making breathing noisy or impossible. It is 
essential to establish a clear airway immediately. Unblocking the breathing passage 
takes priority over concerns about a potential spinal injury.  
3. If the person is not on his back, turn him on to his back.  
4. Kneel beside the casualty. 
5. Lift the chin forwards with the index and middle fingers of one hand while pressing 
the forehead backwards with the palm of the other hand. This manoeuvre will lift 
the tongue forward and clear the airways.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
One should not spend time searching for hidden obstructions. Care should be 
taken not to push any object further down the throat. 
 
Be careful: do not put your fingers in somebody’s closed mouth. 
9. If the breathing restarts, place the patient in the recovery position (see recovery 
position). 
If the casualty still does not breathe, start CPR immediately. 
A.5.2.3 
CPR: HOW TO GIVE CHEST COMPRESSIONS?  
1. Turn the casualty on his back on a hard surface, if not already. 
2. Kneel next to the casualty, beside his upper arm. 
 
 
3. Place the heel of one hand in the center of the person’s chest. 
4. Place the heel of the other hand on top of your first hand.  
If the person’s age is below puberty, only use one hand. 
 
If the victim is a baby, do not use this technique but apply the technique of CPR 
for babies and children under the age of one year. 
5. Lock your fingers of both hands together.  
Do not apply pressure to the person’s ribs. Nor should you press the upper part of the 
stomach or the bottom end of the breast bone. 
6. Make sure your shoulders are directly above the person’s chest. 
7. With outstretched arms, push five to maximum six centimetres downwards. 
8. Release the pressure and avoid leaning on the chest between compressions to 
allow full chest recoil. The compression and release should be of equal duration. 
Each time you press down allow the chest to rise fully again. This will let blood flow 
back to the heart. 
9. Do not allow your hands to shift or come away from the breastbone. 
10. Give 30 chest compressions in this way at a rate of 100 compressions a minute (you 
may go faster, but not more than 120 compressions a minute).  This equates to just 
fewer than two compressions a second. 
 
 


  
29 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
A.5.2.4 
CPR: HOW TO GIVE RESCUE BREATHS? 
If for some reason you cannot or do not want to give rescue breaths, you can just continue giving 
chest compressions (five to maximum six centimetre deep at a rate of 100 compressions a minute). 
 
1. Put one hand on the person’s forehead and tilt back his head. 
2. Put your other hand on the bony part of the chin and lift the chin. 
3. Then pinch the person’s nose with one hand that is on his forehead. 
5. Take a normal breath and then put your mouth completely over the person’s mouth 
and seal with your lips. Calmly blow your air into the mouth of the person’s for one 
second. Check if the person’s chest rises. 
6. If the chest does not rise, take the following steps: 
a. Check if anything is in the person’s mouth. 
If so, remove any visible items that may block the airway. 
b. Check that the head is well tilted and the chin is lifted properly. 
In any case, make no more than two attempts to blow air into the person. 
7. Start another series of 30 chest compressions prior to trying to blow air into the 
person’s mouth again. 
Chest compressions and rescue breaths are tiring to administer. If there are a 
few trained rescuers present, it is best to alternate with each other. 
To ensure that the quality of the chest compressions remains optimal, the rescuers 
should switch every two minutes: 
 
The first rescuer gives 30 chest compressions followed by two ventilations and 
another set of 30 chest compressions and two ventilations. 
 
Then another rescuer takes over and repeats the above steps and switch 
again. 
The switches should happen with minimal interruption and as quickly and smoothly as 
possible. 
8. Do not interrupt the resuscitation until:

RECOVERY POSITION 
The recovery position refers to a lateral prone position of the body, in to which an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious 
but breathing normally casualty can be placed as part of the first aid treatment. 
In an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious person, the muscles are relaxed. This causes the tongue to obstruct the 
airway. This risk can be eliminated by carefully tilting the head back and lifting the chin. The 
recovery position should be used for # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious casualties who are breathing.  
The position of the casualty’s arms and legs provide the necessary stability to keep the body 
in a safe and comfortable position. 
Unblocking the breathing passage takes priority over concerns about a potential spinal 
injury. Unless you can clearly see that the person is breathing normally, an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious 
person must be turned onto his back to unblock the breathing passage and to check 
breathing.

TOP TO TOE ASSESSMENT 
The ‘history of the case’ is the story of the accident, i.e. how the accident actually occurred. 
The casualty will give the history if conscious. If he is # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious, someone who saw the 
accident will help. The surroundings will add to the information, like an abandoned vehicle or 
a damaged area near the place and its condition. 
Symptoms are what the casualty tells the first aider. Examples of symptoms the casualty can 
report about are: 
 
feeling pain, 
 
feeling cold or heat, 
 
getting thirsty, 
 
feeling nauseous, 
 
feeling weak, 
 
feeling dizzy, 
 
feeling fainting, 
 
any loss of normal movement, 
 
any loss of sensation, 
 
temporary loss of consciousness, 
 
loss of memory, 
 
having felt the sensation of breaking a bone,  
 
etc. 
These symptoms described by the casualty can help to lead the first aider to the region of 
injury. 
Signs are what the first aider feels and finds out by himself. 
Examples of these signs are the observed: 
 
breathing, 
 
# BLEEDING bleeding, 
 
colour or paleness, 
 
swelling of injured parts, 
 
deformities of limbs,  
 
other observations of any kind.  
Training helps in making these observations accurately.

A.7.1 
THE INITIAL TOP TO TOE ASSESSMENT 
A general assessment can be carried out to assess any imminent threats to life and whether 
the casualty is conscious or # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious. It should be executed quickly.  
Resuscitation, the stopping of # BLEEDING bleedings and the treatment of any life- threatening issues 
have priority. If the condition of the casualty worsens during the examination, the 
necessary first aid measures should be taken immediately. 
 
During assessment, movement should be as little as possible to avoid further injuries. 
Assess from head toward feet and compare one side of the casualty’s body with the other 
as this helps you to detect any swelling or irregularities that require first aid.

HYGIENE AND HAND WASHING 
A.8.1 
GENERAL HYGIENE NOTES 
When dealing with ill or injured persons it is important to keep the risk of infection between 
yourself and the sick or injured person to a minimum: 
 
If possible, wash your hands with soap and water (40-60 seconds) before and 
definitely after you take care of an ill or injured person. Alternatively, you can also 
use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can also be used, if the 
hands are not visibly soiled (20-30 seconds).  
 
Avoid direct contact with blood or body fluids. 
 
Use gloves if there is blood or other body fluids like urine or vomit. You can also use 
a clean plastic bag to cover the hands. 
 
 
If no gloves or plastic bags are available you can: 
 
Instruct the sick or injured person as to what he can do himself. 
 
Try to avoid contact with blood or body fluids as much as possible when 
you give first aid. 
 
You may decide not to give help if you cannot ensure avoiding contact 
with blood or body fluids. 
 
It is good to have gloves in your first aid kit. 
 
 
Use a sticking plaster, bandage or clean cloth to protect any cuts, grazes, or 
wounds you may have yourself. Infections may spread through breaks in your skin. 
 
Wear shoes to protect your feet from infection. 
 
Use lots of clean water to rinse out any blood or other body fluid that splashes into 
your eyes or mouth, straight away. 
 


  
43 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Dispose of used materials appropriately and clean up any blood spills because it 
can cause infection to others. 
 
Be very careful with sharp objects. They should be disposed of with care (e.g. in a 
box) so that they form no danger to others. 
 
Dispose of any soiled bandages carefully. Put them in a plastic bag or bin and then 
burn or bury them. 
 
Be careful not to use dirty or contaminated materials to treat ill or injured persons 
as these can pass on diseases from one person to another. 
 
You can sterilize material by placing it for 10 minutes in boiling water or running it 
through a flame a few times. 
 
Use clean drinking water or boiled and cooled water if a person needs to drink. 
A.8.2 
TECHNIQUE OF HAND WASHING 
 
1. Wet your hands under running water. 
 
2. Use soap to cover all hand surfaces. If you have liquid soap, this is best. Alternatively 
you can also use ash that is no longer hot to wash your hands. 
 
3. Rub your hands firmly together (40-60 seconds) and wash your hands thoroughly. Make 
sure the soap touches all the parts of your hands. Do not forget the tips of your fingers, 
your thumbs and the skin between your fingers. 


  
44

TITLE OF CHAPTER
B.1 
RESPIRATION 
 
 
Oxygen is essential to life. Every time we breathe in, air containing oxygen enters the lungs. 
When we breathe out air containing waste products is removed from the lungs. In each 
inspiration we take approximately 500 cc of air in.  
Respiration is defined as the transport of oxygen from the outside air to the cells within the body 
tissues, and the transport of carbon dioxide (a waste product) in the opposite direction.  
B.1.1 
THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 
 
B.1.1.1 
THE AIR PASSAGES 
The air passages consist of the nose, throat (pharynx), wind pipe (trachea) and air-tubes 
(bronchi). The bronchi divide into minute branches (bronchioles) which end in the lung 
substance (alveoli). 
B.1.1.2 
THE LUNGS 
The lungs (two in number) are situated on the right and left sides of the chest cavity. Each lung 
is made up of a number of small sacs, called alveoli. The lungs are covered by a membrane 
called ‘pleura’ which lines the inner wall of the chest cavity. 


  
48 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
B.1.2 
THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES 
The respiratory muscles, diaphragm, intercostal and abdominal muscles help to contract and 
expand the lungs to facilitate the breathing. 
B.1.3 
MECHANISM OF RESPIRATION 
 
During inspiration (breathing in), the diaphragm (the muscle separating the chest from the 
abdominal cavity) flattens and increases the chest capacity from above downwards. The ribs 
move upwards and forwards increasing the capacity of the chest cavity from front to back by 
the action of the muscles situated between the ribs; the lungs thus expand and air enters them. 
This is an active process. 
During expiration (breathing out) the reverse process takes place. The diaphragm comes back 
to its original state and the ribs fall back thus forcing the air out of the lungs. This is a passive 
process. 
Small blood vessels (capillaries) surround the alveoli. The exchanges of oxygen and carbon 
dioxide take place through the blood circulating in these capillaries. Oxygen is absorbed by 
the red blood corpuscles of the blood; water vapour and carbon dioxide are let out from the 
blood plasma into the alveoli and expelled out. 
The lungs are also supplied with nerves which are connected to an area in the brain called 
respiratory centre. This centre controls the respiration.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
B.2 
NO BREATHING OR DIFFICULT BREATHING 
 
Asphyxia is a condition in which the lungs do not get sufficient supply of air for breathing. If this 
continues for some minutes, the breathing and heart action stop and death occurs. 
A person can only survive a few minutes without breathing and a beating heart. 
B.2.1 
CAUSES OF NO BREATHING 
B.2.1.1 
CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE AIR PASSAGE 
Following reasons can cause no breathing: 
B.2.1.1.1 
OBSTRUCTION OF THE AIR PASSAGE 
 
foreign body inhalation- as a coin inhaled by a child or artificial tooth by an adult; 
 
food going down the air passage; 
 
sea weeds, mud or water getting into air passage during drowning; 
 
bronchial asthma; 
 
tongue falling back in an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious person; 
 
swelling of tissues of the throat as a result of scalding (burning by steam or boiling 
fluids or corrosives) or allergic reactions; 
 
inhaling irritant gases (coal gas, motor exhaust fumes, smoke, sewer and closed 
granary gas or gas in a deep unused well, etc.). 
B.2.1.1.2 
COMPRESSION OF THE AIR PASSAGE (USUALLY DELIBERATE, SOMETIMES ACCIDENTAL) 
 
Smothering such as covering of the face and nose of an infant or an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious 
person lying face downwards on a pillow, or having a plastic bag covering the face 
of the victim, 
 
tying a rope or scarf tightly around the neck causing strangulation, 
 
hanging or throttling (applying pressure with fingers on the windpipe). 
B.2.1.2 
CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE RESPIRATORY MECHANISM 
 
Epilepsy, tetanus, rabies, etc.; 
 
nerve diseases causing paralysis of the chest wall or diaphragm; 
 
poisonous bites (e.g. # SNAKE_BITE snake bites like the cobra). 
B.2.1.3 
CONDITIONS AFFECTING RESPIRATORY CENTRE 
 
Overdose of morphia or similar products such as barbiturates (sleeping tablets, 
 
electric # SHOCK shock, 
 
stroke. 
B.2.1.4 
COMPRESSION OF THE CHEST 
 
Caving in of earth or sand in mines, quarries, pits or compression by grain in a silo or 
by beams or pillars in house-collapse; 


  
50 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
crushing against a wall or a barrier or pressure in a crowd (stampede). 
B.2.1.5 
LACK OF OXYGEN AT HIGH ALTITUDES  
 
Low atmospheric pressure where the oxygen level in the atmospheric air is low or 
due to lack of acclimatization. 
B.2.2 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
 
The signs of no breathing are: 
 
there is no flow of air out of the nose or mouth (listen, feel the airflow); and 
 
the chest of the victim does not move up and down. 
Note that even after breathing has stopped the heart may continue to beat for a 
short while. If you find a person who is not breathing or not breathing normally, you can 
increase his chances of staying alive by pushing hard and fast in the middle of the 
person’s chest and by giving rescue breaths (CPR). 
 
The signs of asphyxia are: 
 
difficulty in breathing and signs of restlessness; 
 
the rate of breathing increases; 
 
the breaths get shorter; 
 
the veins of the neck become swollen; 
 
the face, lips, nails, fingers and toes turn blue; and 
 
the pulse gets faster and feebler.

DROWNING 
Drowning causes asphyxia by water, weeds and mud entering into the lungs. When the lungs' 
alveoli are filled with water, they cannot exchange oxygen to and from the blood. 
In case of ‘dry drowning’ the water never reaches the lungs. Instead, breathing in water causes 
the vocal cords spasm that shuts off his airways, making it hard to breathe. 
‘Secondary drowning’ happens differently. The swimmer often appears fine immediately after 
swimming. But over time, water left in the swimmer's lungs begins to cause oedema, or swelling.  
If a casualty has been immersed in cold water, there is also the danger of hypothermia. 
It is important to keep the victim warm. 
If the casualty was diving there could be trauma to the head, neck or spine. 
B.3.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
 
 
A victim is in the water and is in distress. 
 
Following signs of drowning may be observed: 
 
no breathing; 
 
difficulty in breathing and signs of restlessness; 
 
the rate of breathing increases; 
 
the breaths get shorter; 
 
the veins of the neck become swollen; 
 
the face, lips, nails, fingers and toes turn blue; 
 
the pulse gets faster and feebler; and 
 
water may gush from the mouth.  
This water is from the stomach and should be left to drain of its own accord. Do 
not attempt to force the water to come out of the stomach as the victim may 
inhale it.

STRANGULATION AND HANGING 
The airway is squeezed if pressure is exerted on the outside of the neck and by such act the 
flow of air into the lungs is cut off. 
Strangulation is a constriction or squeezing around the neck or throat.  Hanging is the 
suspension of the body by a noose around the neck. Hanging or strangulation may occur 
accidentally - for example, by ties or clothing becoming caught in machinery.  
Hanging may cause a broken neck. For this reason the casualty must be handled 
extremely carefully.

CHOKING 
When a person is having severe difficulty in breathing because of an obstructed airway or 
lack of air, he is # CHOKING choking. 
Coughing is the natural way of clearing the airway when the person experiences mild 
# CHOKING choking. It is also a sign that he still gets air through the windpipe. 
Severe # CHOKING choking happens when the foreign object or a local swelling blocks the airway. This 
is a life-threatening emergency. 
Infants and children often choke after swallowing non-edible objects such as coins, marbles, 
seeds, buttons or small toys. 
Most adult cases of # CHOKING choking occur while eating. Since # CHOKING choking often occurs while eating, 
there are usually people present near the casualty. This means there is a good chance 
that someone will be able to give help quickly.  
B.5.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?  
When a person is # CHOKING choking, you may observe the following: 
 
the person has difficulty in breathing, 
 
he tries to cough something out but it does not help, 
 
he cannot speak or make any sound, 
 
he puts his hands on his throat, 
 
the lips and tongue turn blue, 
 
the veins in the face and neck stick out, or 
 
the person becomes dizzy and might lose consciousness.

B.7 
SUFFOCATION BY SMOKE OR GASES 
Asphyxia can occur in an environment where sufficiently oxygenated air is present, but cannot 
be adequately breathed because of air contamination such as excessive smoke, or can occur 
in case of breathing in the oxygen-depleted air. 
An asphyxiant gas is usually a nontoxic or minimally toxic gas which reduces or displaces the 
normal oxygen concentration 
in 
breathing 
air. 
 
Because 
asphyxiant 
gases 
are 
relatively inert and odourless, their presence in high concentration may not be noticed, except 
in the case of carbon dioxide. 
Toxic gases, by contrast, cause death by other mechanisms, such as competing with oxygen 
at the cellular level (e.g., carbon monoxide) or directly damaging the respiratory system. Even 
smaller quantities of these gasses can be deadly. 
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless but highly toxic gas which takes 
the space in haemoglobin that normally carries oxygen, thus makes it ineffective in delivering 
oxygen to body tissues.  Carbon monoxide is produced when there is not enough oxygen to 
produce carbon dioxide (CO2), such as when operating a stove or an internal combustion 
engine in an enclosed space.  Carbon monoxide is lighter than air. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colourless, odourless gas which is heavier than normal air.  It can be 
pocketed in high concentrations in wells, sewerages and mines. 
Other gases like refrigerator gases, compressed gases for cooking or lighting can also cause 
suffocation.

1. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a 
bystander to seek help. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been 
secured. 
2. Make sure there is no danger to you. Do not take any risk that could endanger you. 
The fire brigade has specialized teams and equipment to handle these situations 
safely. 
If the gas is expected to be a deadly poisonous gas, do not enter the affected 
area! 
3. Ensure the circulation of fresh air before entering the area if possible.  
4. Use a gas mask. If not available, before entering the enclosed space, take two or 
three deep breaths and hold your breath as long as you can.   
5. Enter in upright position and stay as high as possible. 
B.7.3.2 
MOVE THE VICTIM TO AN AREA OF FRESH AIR 
6. Move the victim as quickly as possible away from the area. 
7. Loosen the victim’s clothes at neck and waist. 
8. If the breathing stopped, call for help and start CPR. 
9. Always arrange transport for the victim to a healthcare facility for further follow up. 
B.7.3.3 
HYGIENE 
Always wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. 
If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be 
used, if available.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
B.8 
ASTHMA 
Asthma is a condition in which the person’s airways become narrow and swell and produce 
extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness 
of breath. 
For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that 
interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. 
Asthma may not be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Person may be known to have 
asthma and prescribed medications.  This can be established by taking history from the 
casualty. 
B.8.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
Following signs can be seen in a person having an asthma attack: 
 
The person has difficulty in breathing.   
 
The person experiences as if he does not get enough air. 
 
Sometimes the person breathes rapidly or coughs. In some cases he coughs up 
mucus. 
 
The breathing makes a whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling. 
 
The person complains of tightness or pain in the chest. 
 
The person has troubled sleeping due to the shortness of breath. 
 
Symptoms of asphyxia (grey blue tinge of lips and nail-beds). 
 
If the attack lasts long, exhaustion may occur. 
B.8.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
B.8.2.1 
SUPPORT THE PERSON WITH THE ASTHMA ATTACK 
1. Stay calm and reassure the person. 
2. Let the person adopt a position that he finds most comfortable. In many cases this 
is sitting up in bed or on a chair, leaning forward on a couple of pillows or a small 
table on which he rests his head.  
Do not make the person lie down. Important however it is important the person 
adopts the position he finds best. 


  
68 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
3. If the person is used to take inhaler puffs for his condition, let him take the 
medication. 
4. Ensure fresh air by opening a window. Loosen any tight clothing. 
5. If it is the first attack or the attack is severe or the inhaler puffs have no effect, seek 
urgent medical help in a healthcare facility. 
6. If the person loses consciousness, make sure the airway remains open and check 
the breathing. 
7. If the person stops breathing, start CPR. 
B.8.2.2 
HYGIENE 
Always wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. 
If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be 
used, if available. 
B.8.3 
WHEN TO REFER PERSON WITH ASTHMA TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Always urgently transport the person with an asthma crisis to the nearest healthcare 
facility if the asthma crisis continues even after the person took his medication or if 
his condition deteriorates.  
Always advice the person known to be treated for asthma to visit the healthcare facility 
as soon as possible after the asthma crisis for further follow-up and treatment.

THE HEART AND THE BLOOD CIRCULATION 
C.1.1 
HEART AND BLOOD CIRCULATION 
The heart is a muscular organ situated at the centre of the chest cavity. It acts as a pump. It is 
divided into four chambers. The right upper chamber called the right atrium receives impure 
blood from all parts of the body through blood vessels called veins.  
   
When the heart muscle contracts (the heart beats) this impure blood is passed into the right 
lower chamber, called right ventricle, and finally finds its way to the lungs where it is purified. 
During the process of purification, it gives up carbon-dioxide and takes a fresh quantity of 
oxygen. 


  
71 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
The purified blood finds its way into the left upper chamber called left atrium. It then passes to 
the left lower chamber, called left ventricle, and from there, in the course of the beating of the 
heart the purified blood is discharged into various blood vessels called arteries and capillaries 
which convey this purified blood for the nourishment for the body as a whole including the 
heart muscles. Thus each heart is in fact two pumps put together. 
C.1.2 
BLOOD PRESSURE 
The pressure in the arteries varies with the beating of the heart. When the heart contracts the 
pressure in the arterial system increases; when the heart relaxes, the pressure in the arteries 
decreases. The pressure exerted on the main arteries is known as the blood pressure and is 
recorded by a blood pressure measuring instrument. 
C.1.3 
PULSE 
With each heartbeat blood is ejected into the arterial system. Most of the arteries are placed 
deep in the body except on the wrist, elbow, neck, groin and ankle. So arterial pulse is normally 
felt over the lateral side of the wrist, in the neck, temples, and groin and near the ankle. You 
may not be able to feel arteries even at these sites (except carotid artery in the neck which is 
a major artery near to the heart) when the person is in # SHOCK shock. Nevertheless, feeling the pulse 
correctly is not always easy and requires training.  
Pulse rate in a normal resting adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Tachycardia refers 
to the heart beating too fast at rest - over 100 beats per minute.

C.1.4 
THE BLOOD 
A living human body contains different types of fluids. Blood is one of them. It circulates in a 
closed system formed by the heart, the arteries, capillaries and the veins. An average adult 
has a volume of five to six litres blood which constantly circulates.  
The blood is a thick viscid liquid of bright red or scarlet colour when it flows from the heart to 
the arteries and takes a dark red or purple hue when it comes back to the heart via the veins. 
It has a saline taste. 


  
73 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Figure c02 ipv C0 …Blood consists of varieties of cells:  
 
The blood cells which carry haemoglobin (which enables the cells to carry oxygen) 
are red in colour and are known as red blood corpuscles (RBC).  
 
The other cells are white blood corpuscles (WBC) (which play a role in the defence 
of the body against infections) and platelets (which help the blood to clot).  The 
remainder yellowish liquid portion of the blood is called plasma which contains 
proteins, enzymes and other important ingredients. 
 
Whenever blood comes in contact with some external material it tends to solidify, 
forming a clot to stop further # BLEEDING bleeding. When the blood clots inside the arteries, 
veins or the heart it is referred to as a thrombus. 
C.1.5 
HOW BLOOD CLOTS 
When a blood vessel is severed or damaged, it constricts (narrows) in order to prevent 
excessive amounts of blood from escaping.  At a first stage, specialized blood cells called 
platelets come into contact with the damaged vessel wall, become sticky and start to clump 
at the site of the injury. 
Injured tissue cells at the site of the wound together with the clumped platelets, trigger a series 
of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a substance called fibrin. Strands 
(filaments) of fibrin come together to form a mesh, which traps blood cells to make a blood 
clot. The clot releases a pale-coloured fluid, called serum, which contains antibodies and 
specialised cells. The serum begins the process of repairing the damaged area. At first the 
blood clot is a jelly-like mass. Later it dries out into a crust (scab) that seals and protects the site 
of the wound until the healing process is complete.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
C.2 
CHEST DISCOMFORT 
Like all body organs, the heart also needs blood to function properly. If someone 
complains of chest discomfort, it may be a sign that not enough blood is flowing to the heart 
muscles. This is very serious and can indicate that the person may suffer from a heart attack. 
A heart attack happens when there is a blockage of the blood flow to some parts of the 
heart muscle. In that case, a part of the heart muscle starts to die as soon as that region does 
not get any blood supply. It is serious even if the sick person says that nothing is wrong with 
him.  
When a person complains of chest pain, always suspect an impending heart attack. 
However, not every chest discomfort or pain is a heart attack. Several other less problematic 
health problems present with similar symptoms.  
Diagnosing a heart attack may not be easy, even for a trained medical staff!  
Extra alarm bells to make you consider a heart-related problem are: 
 
The pain remains longer than 15 minutes. 
 
The pain is provoked by effort (exertion pain). 
 
There is relief when resting. 
 
The person is known to have cardiac problems or has been prescribed cardiac 
medicines. 
C.2.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
 
You might observe the following signs and symptoms when a person is having a heart attack: 
 
discomfort, tightness or pain in the chest; 
 
pain spreading to the shoulder, neck, jaw, arm or  stomach; 
 
the pain might be described as of a dull, heavy or tight character; 
 
dizziness and fainting; 
 
sweating; 
 
difficulty in normal breathing; 
 
nausea and vomiting; or 
 
distress.

WHAT DO I DO? 
C.2.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP 
1. Make sure there is no danger to you and the person. 
2. The person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave 
the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport 
to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital. Tell him to come back to you to confirm 
if help has been secured. 
C.2.2.2 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
 
3. Make the person lie down in a comfortable position, or propped up position if lying 
down is not possible. A semi- reclined position is often the most comfortable for such 
cases. 
4. Ask him to rest and not move. He should rest wherever he is at that moment. 
5. Loosen tight clothing for more comfort. 
6. Reassure the person and tell him what is happening. 
7. Ask if the person is taking medication for his heart condition. If so, allow the person to 
take the prescribed medication. 
If the patient has prescribed nitro-glycerine with him, it is safe for him to take up to three 
doses. 
 
8. If there is aspirin available, ask the person to chew on an aspirin tablet and swallow it 
with some water afterwards. Tell him that this will help the blood flow to the heart.  
9. Arrange urgent transport to a nearby healthcare facility or hospital. 
10. Keep observing the person in case he collapses.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
C.3 
BLEEDING 
Blood circulates in blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). When a blood vessel is 
damaged, several mechanisms are activated to control blood loss: the vessel constricts, and 
a series of chemical reactions occur to form a blood clot as a “plug” over the damaged area. 
If blood vessels are torn or severed, uncontrolled blood loss may occur before clotting can take 
place, and # SHOCK shock may develop. 
C.3.1 
TYPES OF BLEEDING 
A # BLEEDING bleeding can be classified by the type of the blood vessel that has been damaged: 
 
Arterial # BLEEDING bleeding. 
 
Arteries carry bright red oxygen rich blood under pressure from the heart. If an artery is 
damaged, the # BLEEDING bleeding may be profuse. The blood will spurt out of it in time with the 
heartbeat. If a main artery is severed, the blood may jet several feet high. In this case, the 
volume of the circulating blood will fall rapidly.  
 
Venous # BLEEDING bleeding. 
 
The blood in the veins, having given up its oxygen into the tissues, is dark red. The blood 
flows under less pressure than arterial blood, but the vein walls can widen greatly and the 
blood can ‘pool’ inside them. If a major vein is damaged, the blood may gush from it 
profusely. 
 
 
 
 
 


  
78 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Capillary # BLEEDING bleeding. 
 
Bleeding from the capillaries occurs with any wound. At first the # BLEEDING bleeding may be brisk, but 
blood loss is usually slight. A blow may rupture capillaries under the skin, causing # BLEEDING bleeding 
into the tissues (bruising). 
A # BLEEDING bleeding can also be classified by its location: 
 
External # BLEEDING bleeding. 
If the # BLEEDING bleeding is from the surface of the body, it is called an external # BLEEDING bleeding. 
 
Internal # BLEEDING bleeding. 
If the # BLEEDING bleeding is within the skull, chest and abdomen or inside the body, it is called an 
internal # BLEEDING bleeding. These # BLEEDING bleedings might not been noticed immediately. At a later stage, 
blood might ooze out of the nose or ears (# BLEEDING bleeding inside the head), be coughed up 
(# BLEEDING bleeding inside the lungs), vomited or defecated (# BLEEDING bleeding inside the digestive tract) or 
urinated out (# BLEEDING bleeding inside the urinary tract).

FIRST AID FOR BLEEDING (IN GENERAL) 
C.4.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
A person who has an injury which is # BLEEDING bleeding severely is in a life-threatening situation and needs 
immediate help. Therefore, stopping the # BLEEDING bleeding is a core first aid activity. In addition, 
# BLEEDING bleeding in the face or neck may impede the air flow to the lungs. 
There might be an open wound that is # BLEEDING bleeding. 
 
The # BLEEDING bleeding might be profuse. 
 
There might be an object stuck in the wound. Even if you cannot see an object, 
there might be something stuck in the wound if: 
 
the injured feels pain in a specific area; 
 
the injured person reveals a painful lump; 
 
the injured person feels there is something stuck in the wound; 
 
there is a discoloured area where the pain is. 
Suspect # BLEEDING bleeding inside the body if the injured person: 
 
is losing blood from body cavities (nose, ear(s), mouth, sex organs, anus); 
 
is breathing rapidly; 
 
has a cold and clammy skin that is pale or turns blue; 
 
has a rapid heartbeat (pulse); 
 
is behaving in an irritated or unusual way; 
 
has pain or complains about tenderness; sometimes there is also swelling in the 
abdomen or chest at the place of the suspected internal # BLEEDING bleeding; 
 
becomes sleepy or falls # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious. 
 
Do not raise an injured person’s legs if you suspect an injury to the legs or moving 
the legs is painful. The effect of raising the leg is only limited and moving the legs 
might cause harm.

WOUNDS AND INJURIES 
A wound is an injury in which the skin or another surrounding surface is torn, pierced, cut or 
otherwise broken. Wounds can be external or internal in the body. Each type of wound carries 
specific risks associated with the surrounding tissue damage and infection. 
D.1 
TYPES OF WOUNDS 
 
Abrasions 
 
These wounds are superficial wounds in which the top most layers of the skin are scraped 
off, leaving a raw, tender area. These wounds appear often when experiencing a sliding 
fall (e.g. of a bike). The wounds often contain embedded foreign particles which may 
result in infections. Abrasions do not bleed much, but are usually very painful. 
 
Incisions 
 
Incised wounds are caused by sharp instruments such as a knife, razor, etc. The blood 
vessels show a straight cut and # BLEEDING bleeding may be profuse. Other structures such as tendons 
and nerves may be damaged too. 
 
Contusions (bruises) 
 
Contused wounds are caused by blows, by blunt instruments or by punching. The 
capillaries are ruptured by the punch and blood leaks into the tissues. Severe contusion 
might be an indication of a deeper damage, like a # FRACTURE fracture or internal injury. 


  
88 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Lacerations 
 
Lacerated wounds are caused by crushing, ripping forces by machinery, or clawing of 
animals resulting in tears or lacerations. The edges are mostly irregular in shape. There is 
usually more underlying tissue damage. These wounds are often contaminated with 
germs; the risk of infection is high. This type of wound sometimes has less # BLEEDING bleeding, but is 
usually very painful. 
 
Puncture wounds 
 
Puncture wounds are caused by stabs or sharp instruments like knifes, daggers or nails. 
These wounds typically have a smaller opening, but may reach deep into the tissue. These 
may not be very painful. 
 
A stab wound is a puncture wound by a knife or sharp blade. A gunshot wound is the 
wound caused by a bullet or missile driven into the body. The entry wounds of gunshot 
wounds are mostly small and neat. If the projectile also exits the body, the exit wound may 
be large and ragged.

Amputations 
 
 
Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma. Re-attachment of amputated limbs, fingers 
or toes might be possible if the injured and the amputated part(s) arrive at the hospital as 
soon as possible. 
D.1.1 
COMPLICATIONS OF WOUNDS 
Wounds can cause two great dangers: 
 
Bleeding, and  
 
Infection 
D.1.1.1 
BLEEDING 
Bleeding is the immediate complication of a wound and must be treated immediately.  
D.1.1.2 
INFECTION 
Germs are tiny, not visible to the human eye, organisms that can cause diseases. Germs are 
bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. 
An infection is caused by germs getting into the body through the broken skin. The germs 
multiply in the wound and make it ‘infected’, also called as ‘septic’. Germs may later get into 
the bloodstream and cause a septicaemia. 
A wound is initially not infected, even though it may be contaminated by dirt or materials that 
contain germs. An infection occurs after a lapse of time when the germs have time to multiply 
and invade the tissues. This time varies with the number of germs and their virulence and the 
body’s resistance to fight back. Pus formation is part of the body’s method to fight an infection. 
The prevention of infection is very important. The first step consists of personal hygiene and the 
washing of your hands prior and after taking care of a person.

D.2 
SMALL CUTS AND ABRASIONS 
Even if the injured person has a small cut or abrasions, you will still need to take care of the 
wound to stop the # BLEEDING bleeding and to prevent infection. 
D.2.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?  
You might observe the following signs on a person with a cut or abrasions: 
 
the skin or the tissue is damaged, 
 
open skin or tissue might be # BLEEDING bleeding, 
 
the # BLEEDING bleeding might be minor or profuse, 
 
the skin might be discoloured, or 
 
the casualty might feel pain. 
D.2.2 
WHAT DO I DO?  
D.2.2.1 
HYGIENE 
1. Wash your hands before giving care. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no 
soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can 
also be used, if available. 
D.2.2.2 
STOP THE BLEEDING AND BANDAGE THE WOUND 
 
2. Try to stop or slow down the # BLEEDING bleeding: press on the wound with a clean cloth or 
bandage. If possible, ask the injured person to press on the cut or graze himself to stop 
the # BLEEDING bleeding. 
 
3. Rinse out the wound with clean water. You can also use boiled and cooled water. 


  
91 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Pour water on the wound until you cannot see any foreign material left in the wound. If 
necessary, wash out the wound under running water. Foreign material means dirt or 
anything else that comes from outside the injured person’s body. 
In the event the wound is # BLEEDING bleeding profusely, do not waste time cleaning it. 
Your priority is to stop the # BLEEDING bleeding by applying pressure on the wound. 
 
4. If you have a piece of clean (cotton) cloth, then cover the wound with it. Use adhesive 
strips to close a clean cut. If no strips are available, use a bandage. Bandage the 
dressing to the wound.  
Do not apply the bandage too firmly. If the part of the body below the bandage 
changes colour, is swelling or is feeling numb, loosen the bandage a little bit. 
 
5. Tell the injured person or the person caring for him to keep the wound dry after 
cleaning with water or getting wet.  Every 2 or 3 days, the wound should be cleaned 
and the dressing changed. 
 
6. If a dressing needs to be changed, do not tear the old one off as this can damage the 
healing wound. Instead, put enough w a t e r (p re f e r a bly s al in e  w a te r if  
av ail a bl e ) on the old dressing so that it comes off easily. 
7. If the wound is infected, then always refer him to a healthcare facility for further 
care. 


  
92 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Even small wounds need attention to prevent infection. Even if the injured person has 
received appropriate medical care, there is a need to watch out for infection in the wound. 
The following signs might indicate an infection: 
 
pain that is getting worse; 
 
swelling, hot or red skin around the wound; 
 
the wound shows discharge, or 
 
person having fever or feeling unwell. 
In these cases the injured should seek further medical help. 
D.2.2.3 
HYGIENE 
Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no 
soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, 
if available. 
 
 
 
 


  
93 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
D.3 
HEAD INJURIES 
The scalp has many small blood vessels near the skin surface. Any cut can result in profuse 
# BLEEDING bleeding and may make the wound appear worse than it is. 
In case of a severe head injury, a watery fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) and blood may flow out of 
the nose, ear(s) or mouth.  
In case of suspecting a severe head injury:  
1. Ask the injured not to blow his nose. 
2. Do not pack the ear or nose. You may eventually place a light dressing on the ear 
or nose. 
3. If the person is breathing, put him in recovery position. Be aware of the risk of neck 
(spinal) injury. 
4. Urgent transport to the nearest hospital is required. 
5. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
Always urgently transport the casualty with a suspected head injury to the nearest 
healthcare facility, 
D.3.1 
NOSE BLEED 
The nose contains small blood vessels that can bleed easily. A nosebleed can be the result 
of a blow to the nose or a trauma to the face, but can also occur spontaneously because of 
dryness inside the nose. Other causes include a foreign object in the nose, infection, common 
cold, allergies, high blood pressure, high altitude, a dry environment, alcohol abuse, disease 
and the use of certain medication. 
During a nosebleed, blood may flow from one or both nostrils. This flow may last from a few 
seconds to several minutes. 
 
In case of a nose bleed: 
1. Ask the person to pinch his nose above the nostrils with index finger and thumb. Tell the 
injured person to breathe through the mouth. Ask the injured person to lean forward so 
that he does not swallow or breathe in blood. Swallowing blood can make the person 
feel sick. 
2. Pinch the nostrils for 10 to 15 minutes. If necessary, pinch the injured person’s nose 
yourself.  


  
94 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
In a few cases a nose bleed can be serious and lead to death.  
The person should seek medical help if: 
 
blood is still coming from the nose after 20 minutes; 
 
the nosebleed was caused by a hard punch on the nose; a fall, a road 
accident, etc.; 
 
blood spurts from the nose, or 
 
the injured  person  turns  pale, becomes  sleepy  or  falls # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious. 
3. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
D.3.2 
BLEEDING OF THE GUMS 
Bleeding may occur immediately or after some time after a tooth extraction. 
 
In case of a # BLEEDING bleeding of the gums: 
1. The person may rinse his mouth with water or saline water.  
2. A thick cotton ball can be put in the casualty’s teeth socket and tell him to bite on 
the cotton ball to stop the # BLEEDING bleeding. 
3. Refer the person to a healthcare facility.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
D.4 
CHEST INJURIES 
Injuries to the chest are always serious. Without being visible, there might be # FRACTURE fractures of the 
ribs, tear of the lung, injury to the heart and injuries to blood vessels.  
In case of a penetrating injury a condition called ‘pneumothorax’ may occur. Air can enter 
between the lung membranes and exert pressure on the lung and make the lung to collapse. 
The pressure may build up effecting the other lung making the injured breathless. 
Air may also come out from the wound during breathing. 
In case of a chest injury: 
 
1. Place him in a half-sitting position and control the # BLEEDING bleeding by providing direct 
pressure to the wound.  Leave the open chest wound exposed. Do not apply an 
occlusive dressing. Eventually put a light dressing on the wound that is not 
occlusive. 
2. Reassure the casualty. 
3. You may also encourage the injured to lean towards the injured side and use his 
hand to cover the penetration wound. 
4. If the casualty becomes # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious but keeps breathing, put him in the recovery 
position. 
5. If the casualty stops breathing, start CPR. 
6. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest hospital. 
7. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
Always urgently transport the casualty with a chest injury to the nearest healthcare 
facility, 
 
 


  
96 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
D.5 
ABDOMINAL INJURIES 
Stab wounds, gun shots or crush injuries to the abdomen cause serious and potentially life-
threatening wounds.  
In case of an abdominal injury: 
1. Control the # BLEEDING bleeding by providing direct pressure to the wound.   
2. Put a clean cotton bandage on the wound. 
3. Adjust the position of the victim so the wound does not gap 
 
4. If the intestines come out: 
Cover the intestines with a clean plastic bag or a clean pad. 
Do not touch the intestines that came out. 
5. Do not give anything to drink or eat. 
6. If the casualty becomes # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious but is breathing, put him in the recovery 
position. 
7. If the casualty stops breathing, start CPR. 
8. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest hospital. 
9. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
Always urgently transport the casualty with an abdominal injury to the nearest 
healthcare facility,

TITLE OF CHAPTER
D.6 
BLEEDING FROM VARICOSE VEINS 
Swollen knobbly dilated veins, as often found in the legs, are called varices. Bleeding from 
varicose veins might be very profuse. 
In case of a varicose vein # BLEEDING bleeding: 
1. Ask the person to lie down on the floor. 
 
2. Raise and support the affected leg (this might help to slow down the # BLEEDING bleeding). 
Apply at the same time direct pressure to the site of the # BLEEDING bleeding. 
3. Put a bandage on the wound. 
4. Refer the person to a healthcare facility. Transport the person to the hospital if the 
# BLEEDING bleeding can’t be stopped. 
5. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
Transport the person to the nearest healthcare facility if the # BLEEDING bleeding can’t be 
stopped.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
D.7 
AMPUTATION 
Re-attachment of amputated limbs, fingers or toes might be possible if the injured and the 
amputated part(s) arrive at the hospital as soon as possible. 
In case of an amputation: 
 
1. Control the # BLEEDING bleeding by providing direct pressure to the wound.  Put a clean cotton 
bandage on the wound. 
 
2. Place the amputated part in a clean plastic bag.  
3. If possible, place the packed amputated part in a container of ice. Do not put ice 
directly on the amputated part – the amputated part should always be packed in 
a clean plastic bag.   
Do not put liquids or antiseptic products on the amputated part. 
 
4. Mark the package clearly with the casualty’s name and the time the amputation 
occurred. 
5. Arrange urgent transport of the casualty and the amputated part to the nearest 
hospital. 


  
99 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
6. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
Always urgently transport the casualty suffering an amputation injury to the 
nearest healthcare facility, If the amputated part has been recovered, do not 
forget to send it together with the casualty. 
 
 


  
100 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
D.8 
CRUSH INJURIES 
Traffic accidents, building site accidents, explosions and natural disasters (e.g. landslides, 
earthquakes) are the most common causes of crush injuries. Crush injuries may include 
# FRACTURE fractures, # BLEEDING bleedings and swelling.  
In case of a crush injury: 
1. Try to keep the head of the victim as low as possible. 
2. Monitor the respiration and consciousness of the victim. 
3. If the victim stops breathing, start CPR. 
4. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital. 
5. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
Always urgently transport a casualty suffering (potential) crush injuries to the nearest 
healthcare facility, 
 
 


  
101 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
D.9 
SHOCK 
This life-threatening condition occurs when the circulatory system fails and as a result vital 
organs such as the heart and the brain are deprived of oxygen. It requires emergency 
treatment to prevent permanent organ damage and death. 
Shock can be made worse by fear and pain. Whenever there is a risk of # SHOCK shock developing, 
reassuring the casualty, making him comfortable and keeping him warm may be sufficient to 
prevent him from deteriorating. 
D.9.1 
CAUSES OF SHOCK 
 
Hypovolemic # SHOCK shock 
The most common cause of # SHOCK shock is severe blood loss. If the blood loss exceeds 1.2 litres 
(this is about one-fifth of the normal blood volume of an adult), # SHOCK shock may occur. The 
blood loss may occur due to external and/or internal # BLEEDING bleedings.  
Loss of other body fluids can also result in # SHOCK shock. Conditions that cause heavy fluid losses 
include diarrhoea, severe # BURNS burns, etc.  
 
Cardiogenic # SHOCK shock 
In addition, # SHOCK shock may occur when an adequate volume of blood is available, but the 
heart is unable to pump the blood around. This problem can be due to severe heart 
diseases, heart attack or acute heart failure. 
 
Other types of # SHOCK shock 
Other causes of # SHOCK shock include overwhelming infections (septic # SHOCK shock), lack of certain 
hormones, low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia) (metabolic # SHOCK shock), under-cooling 
(hypothermia), injuries to the respiratory track or lungs (respiratory # SHOCK shock) and severe 
allergic reactions (anaphylactic # SHOCK shock), drug overdose or spinal cord injuries (neurogenic 
# SHOCK shock). 
D.9.2 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You might observe following symptoms: 
 
Initially: 
 
rapid pulse; 
 
pale looks; 
 
cold clammy, sweaty skin. 
 
As # SHOCK shock develops: 
 
rapid, shallow breathing; 
 
cold, clammy skin; 
 
rapid, weak pulse; 
 
dizziness or fainting; 
 
weakness; 
 
eyes appear to stare; 


  
102 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
anxiety or agitation; 
 
seizures; 
 
confusion or unresponsiveness; 
 
low or no urine output; 
 
bluish lips and fingernails; 
 
sweating; 
 
nausea and vomiting might occur. 
 
The casualty might feel thirsty. 
 
The casualty might become restlessness and aggressive. 
 
The casualty might complain of chest pain. 
D.9.3 
WHAT DO I DO? 
1. Reassure the casualty (when conscious) 
2. Treat the possible cause of # SHOCK shock that you can detect, such as a severe # BLEEDING bleeding. 
3. Lay the casualty comfortably on his back on a blanket.  
However, in cases of injury of the head, chest or of the abdomen, lower the head 
slightly and turn it to a side.   
In cases of vomiting put the casualty in the recovery position. 
4. You may raise and support the legs. However, do not do this when you suspect a 
# FRACTURE fracture or spinal injuries. 
5. Loosen the tight clothing. 
6. Keep the injured person warm by taking off wet clothing, covering him with a 
blanket or other covering, taking care not to overheat him.  
Never use hot water bottles or very warm rugs.  
Do not rub any part of the body to get him warm. 
7. In case of major injuries nothing should be given by mouth as he may later need an 
operation or blood transfusion. 
The general principle is never to give food or drink to a casualty.  Important 
exceptions include hypothermia (low body temperature), hypoglycaemic # SHOCK shock 
(low blood sugar in a diabetes patient), diarrhoea and fever leading to 
dehydration and in case of heat exhaustion or heatstroke when the person remains 
conscious. 
8. Observe the casualty’s consciousness and breathing. 
9. If the casualty loses consciousness, put him in the recovery position. 
10. If the casualty stops breathing, start CPR. 
11. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital.

105 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
E.1 
THE SKELETON 
 
The skeleton forms the supporting framework of the body and consists of 206 separate bones 
in an adult joined together by means of cartilage, ligaments and muscles. 
The bones in different parts: 
 
Head and face: skull, two cheek bones and lower jaw bones. 
 
Body: back bone or spine, the ribs and breast bone. 
 
Upper limbs: arm, forearm (long bones), and palm (short bones). 
 
Hip: the pelvis. 
 
Lower limbs: thigh and Leg (long bones), foot (short bones). 
E.1.1 
THE SKULL 
The skull is made up of 22 bones (21 immobile, 1 mobile) joined together: 
 
one in the front, corresponding to the forehead, called the frontal bone; 
 
two, one on either side, called the parietal bones; 
 
two, one on either side below the parietals, at the level of ears, called the temporal 
bones; 
 
one behind, corresponding to the back of the head, called the occipital bone; 
 
the 5 bones that make up the skull base are the ethmoid, sphenoid, occipital, 
paired frontal, and paired temporal bones; 
 
two cheek bones on each side (called maxilla, zygomatic bones), two nasal bones 
and one lower jaw bone (called the mandible) (face); and 


  
106 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
two small bones located at the tear channels of the eye, called the lacrimal bones. 
The bones of the skull provide protection for the brain and the organs of vision, taste, hearing, 
equilibrium, and smell. The bones also provide attachment for muscles that move the head 
and control facial expressions and chewing. 
E.1.2 
THE BACKBONE OR SPINE (VERTEBRAL COLUMN) 
The vertebral column consists of 33 small pieces of bones, each called a vertebra (plural: 
vertebrae), placed one above the other starting from skull to the tail bone below. 
 
The vertebral column can be divided in different regions: 
 
7 cervical vertebrae in the neck referred to as C1-C7; 
 
12 thoracic or dorsal vertebrae from the back referred to as T1-T12; 
 
5 lumbar vertebrae at the waist region form the lower back referred to as L1-L5; 
 
5 sacral vertebrae at the hip region, fused together, form the sacrum; and 
 
the remaining four form the tail bones. 
Between each pair of vertebrae is a disk of cartilage that acts as a # SHOCK shock absorber and allows 
movement. Muscles and ligaments attached to the vertebrae stabilize the spine and control 
the movement of the back. Inside the central canal the spinal cord passes which carries 
impulses from and to the brain. 


  
107 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
E.1.3 
THE RIBS AND BREAST BONE (STERNUM) 
 
The lungs and heart are protected by the thoracic cage. It consists of twelve pairs of ribs, 
attached to the corresponding vertebrae at the back. The first seven pairs of the ribs are 
attached to the breastbone (also called sternum) in the front. The eighth, ninth and tenth pairs 
of ribs are each attached to the rib above. The eleventh and twelfth pair of ribs have no frontal 
attachment and are called floating ribs. 
E.1.4 
THE SHOULDERS AND UPPER LIMBS (ARM, ELBOW, WRIST AND HAND) 
 
 
E.1.4.1 
THE SHOULDER 
Each shoulder consists of following bones: 
 
a collar bone (Clavicle) in the front on each side of the upper part of the breast 
bone, and 
 
a shoulder blade (Scapula) on each side at the upper outer back. 


  
108 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
E.1.4.2 
THE UPPER LIMB: ARM, ELBOW, WRIST AND HAND 
The bones of the upper limbs (arms) are: 
 
the upper arm, called humerus; 
 
the forearm bones: 
 
The outer side forearm bone or radius, 
 
The inner side forearm bone or ulna. 
The joint between the upper arm and forearm is called the elbow. 
There are eight carpal bones in each wrist, five metacarpal bones in each palm and three 
small bones called phalanges in each finger (only two in each thumb). 
E.1.5 
THE PELVIS AND LOWER LIMBS (LEG, KNEE, ANKLE AND FOOT) 
E.1.5.1 
THE PELVIS 
Two hip bones, one on either side, join together to form the pelvis. The hip bones are attached 
at the back with the lower part of the vertebral column.  At the front, it is attached together 
with ligament called symphysis pubis.  
The pelvis forms a basin shaped cavity which contains intestines, urinary bladder and 
reproductive organs. There are two sockets one on either side of the pelvis, where the thigh 
bones join forming the hip joint. 
E.1.5.2 
THE LOWER LIMB: LEG, KNEE, ANKLE AND FOOT 
The thigh bone, called femur, is the longest and strongest bone in the body. Its upper end forms 
a part of the hip joint while its lower end forms a part of the knee joint.  
The knee joint in the front is covered with a small bone called the knee cap or patella, which 
can easily be felt under the skin. 


  
109 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
The two bones of the lower part of the leg are the shin bone, called tibia, and the outer bone, 
called fibula. The tibia extends from the knee joint to the ankle joint. Its sharp edge can be felt 
immediately beneath the skin of the front of the leg. The fibula lies on the outer side of the tibia. 
It does not enter in to the formation of the knee-joint; its lower end forms the outer part of the 
ankle-joint.  
There are seven tarsal bones and five metatarsal bones in each foot, and three small bones 
called phalanges in each finger (two in each big toe).  
 
 


  
110 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
E.2 
JOINTS 
Joints are the places at the junction of two or more bones.  
There may be no movement (immovable joints) as in skull or there may be free movements 
(movable joints) as in knee, elbow, shoulder and hip joints.  
In movable joints, the ends of the bones are covered by cartilage, the joint is encased in a 
capsule containing a lubricant material. 
There are three types of movable joints: 
 
Ball and socket joints as found in the shoulder and hip. The round head of the bone 
enters the socket of the other bone, allowing movement in several directions and 
planes. 
 
Hinge joints as the ankle, elbow or the knee. These joints allow only movement in 
one plane only as with the hinge of a door. 
 
Gliding joints as in the wrist, feet, between the ribs and the vertebras of the spinal 
column. These joints allow only limited movements. 
 
 
 
 


  
111 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
E.3 
MUSCLES 
Muscles to the layman mean “flesh” and produce movement of the limbs and organs. 
An individual muscle consists of bundles of long muscle fibres. The whole muscle is covered with 
a strong connective tissue sheath and attached to a bone by inextensible tendons.  
There are two types of muscles:  
 
Voluntary muscles, which are under the control of the will and are generally 
attached to the skeleton.  
 
Involuntary muscles, like those found in the heart and digestive system, work without 
the control of the will, but are under the influence of the autonomous nervous 
system.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
E.4 
FRACTURES (INJURIES TO BONES) 
A # FRACTURE fracture is a break/bend or crack in a bone. Generally, a considerable force is needed to 
break a bone, unless it is diseased or old. The bones that are still growing are supple and may 
split, bend, or crack.  
E.4.1 
CAUSES OF FRACTURES 
Fractures may happen when direct (a blow) or indirect force (a twist, a wrench) is inflicted on 
a bone.  
E.4.1.1 
DIRECT FORCE 
The bone breaks at the spot of application of the force e.g. a severe fall on a projecting stone, 
a bullet passing into bones, or a wheel passing over the body, etc. 
E.4.1.2 
INDIRECT FORCE 
The bone breaks at the spot away from the spot of application of force e.g. collar-bone-
# FRACTURE fracture when the fall is on outstretched hands, etc. 
E.4.1.3 
MUSCULAR FORCE 
The # FRACTURE fracture occurs due to a violent contraction of a group of muscles (e.g. # FRACTURE fracture of ribs on 
violent cough). This type of # FRACTURE fracture happens very rarely and is mostly related to other 
underlying diseases (e.g. weakened bone structure). 
 
 


  
113 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
E.4.2 
TYPES OF FRACTURES 
 
E.4.2.1 
OPEN AND CLOSED FRACTURES 
E.4.2.1.1 
CLOSED FRACTURES 
The skin above the # FRACTURE fracture is intact, although the bone ends may have damaged nearby 
tissues and blood vessels.  
E.4.2.1.2 
OPEN FRACTURES (COMPOUND FRACTURES) 
The skin above the # FRACTURE fracture is not intact. There is # BLEEDING bleeding. The bone is exposed to the outside 
air at the surface; dirt, dust and germs can enter the wound. There is a high risk of infection. 
E.4.2.2 
SIMPLE AND COMPLEX FRACTURES 
The term “complex # FRACTURE fracture” describes a broken bone that is more severe than what is more 
common. Fractures are considered to be complex when: 
 
The bones are broken into many pieces. 
 
The soft tissues and vital organs are severely damaged. 
 
There are multiple # FRACTURE fractures at several levels in a single bone. 
 
There is an associated joint dislocation or joint injury. 
Otherwise, the # FRACTURE fracture can be classified as a ‘simple # FRACTURE fracture’. 
E.4.3 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
Following signs and symptoms may be observed when a person suffered a # FRACTURE fracture: 
 
The injured complains of pain at the spot of # FRACTURE fracture or around it. 
 
The injured complains of tenderness i.e. pain on touching over the injured spot. 
Never press hard on a suspected # FRACTURE fracture spot! 
 
There might be swelling of the area of the # FRACTURE fracture. 
 
There might be a # BLEEDING bleeding at the location of the # FRACTURE fracture. 
 
The bone might be sticking out. 
 
There might be a discoloration in the area of the # FRACTURE fracture. 
 
The injured may have lost the capability of normal movements of the affected part. 


  
114 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
There might be a deformity of the affected limb. The limb may have lost its normal 
shape. Sometimes the muscles may pull up the lower free end, causing an 
apparent shortening of the limb. 
 
An irregular outline of the bone can be felt (e.g. on lower limb # FRACTURE fractures).  
 
The injured may feel an unnatural movement at the spot of # FRACTURE fracture. 
The response of an injured person to a dislocated limb or a broken bone can be very 
different. Some people might even be able to walk with a broken leg with some pain, whilst 
others might not be able to move at all. 
If you are not sure whether a bone is broken, it is safer to assume that it has broken. 
If the broken leg looks deformed or dislocated, do not try to reset it. This might make the injury 
worse and will cause pain. 
E.4.4 
WHAT DO I DO? 
E.4.4.1 
SAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP 
1. Make sure there is no danger to you and the person. 
2. The person needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the 
person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange transport to the 
nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been 
secured. 
E.4.4.2 
HYGIENE 
3. If possible, wash your hands before taking care of the injured. Use soap and water 
to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. 
Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.   
4. Use gloves to protect yourself. If gloves are not available, you can use a clean 
plastic bag. Try not to come in contact with the person’s blood. 
E.4.4.3 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
5. Fractures often occur in major accidents. Therefore, it is necessary to treat other 
potential injuries also. The first aider must decide which injury is more urgent.  
Providing CPR when the victim does not breathe, or treating a severe # BLEEDING bleeding is 
more urgent and should be handled on priority. 
6. There may be more than one # FRACTURE fracture in the same patient or even in the same limb. 
7. Try not to move the broken or dislocated limb unnecessarily.  
Try not to move the casualty until the injured part has been secured. 
If you need to move the victim, be careful when moving or turning him.  It is better 
to ask assistance by bystanders. 
8. Reassure the casualty. 
9. Advice the person to keep calm.  


  
115 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
10. If the casualty is able to support the injured part, ask him to do so; else, support the 
injured part with your hands or ask a bystander to do so. 
You can immobilize the injured part with a bandage or a splint (if the first aider is 
experienced in these techniques). If you applied a splint or bandage, check the 
circulation below the bandage or splinting (e.g. at finger or toe level). 
11. Arrange appropriate transport to the nearest healthcare facility. 
12. Continuously observe the casualty. 
13. Do not give the casualty anything to eat or drink. 
E.4.4.3.1 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THERE IS ALSO A SEVERE BLEEDING? 
      Press on the # BLEEDING bleeding to stop it and put a pressure bandage on the wound. 
E.4.4.3.2 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON BECOMES UNCONSCIOUS, BUT IS STILL BREATHING? 
1. Put the person in the recovery position.  
2. Continue to observe the victim and check his breathing. 
E.4.4.3.3 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON STOPS BREATHING? 
       Perform CPR.  
Do not interrupt the resuscitation until:  
 
 the victim starts to wake up, moves, opens his eyes and breathes normally; 
 
help (trained in CPR) arrives and takes over; 
 
you become too exhausted to continue; or 
 
the scene becomes unsafe for you to continue. 
E.4.4.4 
HYGIENE 
Always wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. 
If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also 
be used, if available. 
E.4.5 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Always transport or refer a person suffering a (potential) # FRACTURE fracture to a nearby 
healthcare facility. 
A treatment by bonesetters is not recommended.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
E.5 
INJURIES AND FRACTURES TO THE HEAD, NECK AND SPINE 
Head, neck and spinal injuries can be very serious and should always be managed with 
caution! 
Unblocking the breathing passage takes priority over concerns about a potential spinal 
injury.  When a person needs to be put in the recovery position to keep the airways open, this 
takes priority over potential spinal injury. If possible, support the person’s neck while turning 
him into the recovery position. 
E.5.1 
CAUSES OF HEAD, NECK AND SPINAL INJURIES AND FRACTURES. 
Fractures of the skull can be caused by a direct blow or a fall on the head.   
Fractures of the base of the skull can be caused by an indirect injury, e.g. a fall on the feet, a 
fall on the lower part of the spine (buttock) or a severe blow to the side of the head. 
Fractures of the lower jaw are mostly the result of a direct force. Usually one side of the jaw is 
affected; however, both sides might be # FRACTURE fractured. In most cases, the # FRACTURE fracture is an open 
(compound) # FRACTURE fracture as there is usually a wound inside the mouth also. 
Spinal # FRACTURE fractures can happen indirectly when landing on the feet or buttocks in a heavy fall, 
when being thrown forward suddenly (like in a car accident during a collision) or when lifting a 
very heavy weight.  A whiplash injury is a specific neck injury caused by a fast movement of 
the head forward and backwards (e.g. during a car collision).   
Direct spinal # FRACTURE fractures can be caused by falling from a height on the back across a bar or a 
fall of a heavy weight on the back (e.g. during an earthquake or landslide) 
E.5.2 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You should suspect a potential serious injury if the person: 
 
fell from a height greater than his own standing height; 
 
was involved in a road accident and suffered a hard blow; 
 
is feeling nausea or is vomiting (throwing-up); 
 
does not remember exactly what has happened; 
 
is behaving in an irritated or unusual way after the accident; 
 
complains of blurring vision; 
 
feels pain or tenderness in the head, neck or back; 
 
has serious wounds or injuries to the head; 
 
has serious injuries on the legs and does not complain about pain; 
 
feels like he has been cut in half; 
 
is sleepy, drowsy or loses (has lost) consciousness; 
 
has a fit; or 
 
has an unequal pupil size. 
Blood and brain fluid (CSF) may flow from the ear and/or nose in case of # FRACTURE fracture of base of 
skull.

transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if 
help has been secured. 
E.5.3.2 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
 
3. Tap him on the shoulders and ask if he is okay.  Do not shake the person too roughly. 
4. Check if the injured is conscious or # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious and act accordingly. 
To do so: 
Check if the person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions: 
 
‘What is your name?’ 
 
‘Where do you live?’ 
 
‘How old are you?’ 
Check if the injured person responds to simple commands: 
 
“Squeeze my hand?” 
 
“Move your arm/leg/foot/hand” 
If there is no response, pinch the person and check if he opens his eyes or moves. 
If the injured person responds, do not try to change the position of the person when 
there is a head, neck, back and leg or arm injury.   
 


  
118 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
5. Tell the person to stay calm and not to move. 
6. Assure the person that you will stay with him and help is being arranged. 
 
7. To keep the head still, place your hands or tightly folded clothing on each side of the 
injured person’s head. Keep the head and neck of the person still only if the person 
allows you to do so. 
8. If the injured does not allow you to hold his head, do not enforce. 
9. If the spinal cord injury is suspected, try to ensure that: 
a. The injured person continues to lie still until transported to a hospital. 
b. The injured person is not made to sit or stand. 
c. At least 3 people assist in moving the person ‘like a log of wood’ to transport 
him to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital. 
 
10. Keep the injured person warm by taking off wet clothing, covering him with a 
blanket or other covering, taking care not to overheat him. 
11. If not done yet, arrange transport to a healthcare facility. 
12. Do not leave the person alone and keep on checking his breathing. 
13. Do not give the casualty anything to drink or eat.

INJURIES TO THE ARM, ELBOW, WRIST, HAND OR FINGERS 
E.8.1 
INJURIES AND FRACTURES OF THE ARM (UPPER ARM, FORE ARM, WRIST) 
E.8.1.1 
CAUSES OF INJURIES AND FRACTURES OF THE ARM 
Fractures and injuries of the upper arm, forearm and wrist can be caused by direct impact or 
by falls. 
E.8.1.2 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You might observe following signs and symptoms: 
 
The casualty complains of pain that increases with movement. 
 
There might be tenderness and deformity over the site of the # FRACTURE fracture. 
 
There might be swelling of the affected area. 
 
There might be bruising observed (though this might develop slowly). 
 
If there is an open # FRACTURE fracture, a wound and # BLEEDING bleeding can be observed. 
E.8.1.3 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN I SUSPECT A BROKEN ARM? 
E.8.1.3.1 
SAFETY FIRST  
1. Make sure there is no danger to you and the person. 
E.8.1.3.2 
HYGIENE 
2. If possible, wash your hands before taking care of the injured. Use soap and water 
to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. 
Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
3. Use gloves to protect yourself. If no gloves are available, you can use a clean 
plastic bag. 
4. Try not to come in contact with the person’s blood. 
E.8.1.3.3 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
 
5. Tell the person to immobilise the affected arm by holding his arm close to his body until 
he obtains medical care. 
6. If the person cannot support the arm, provide a sling with a triangular bandage or 
improvise by turning up the lower end of the clothing and pining it above the arm to 
form a sling. 


  
130 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
7. You might also immobilize the arm using a triangular bandage (see the chapter on 
bandages) to support the wrist and arm. Provide suitable padding between arm 
and chest. 
In case of a suspected upper arm # FRACTURE fracture, you might bandage the upper arm to 
the chest.  
 
Do not apply the bandage on the immediate site of the # FRACTURE fracture.  
 
Always tie the knots (reef knot) on the opposite side of the thorax and not on 
the # FRACTURE fractured forearm. 
 
The bandaging should be fairly firm so there is no movement of the # FRACTURE fracture 
ends, but it should not be too tight in which case the circulation of blood might 
be stopped.  
 
Always check that the fingers are not too cold and the splint is not too tight. There 
might be further swelling of the injured area and readjustment of the bandages 
might be necessary.  
 
In case of a suspected forearm # FRACTURE fracture, you might apply a splint (only when the 
necessary expertise is available): 
 
A splint is a rigid piece of wood, plastic or metal that is applied to the # FRACTURE fractured 
limb to support it and to prevent further movement of the broken bone(s). 
 
Reasonably wide splints are better than narrow ones.  
 
In emergency cases splints can be improvised: a folded newspaper, a piece 
of wood or a book can be used. 
 
The splint should be long enough to immobilize the elbow and the wrist of 
# FRACTURE fractured forearm. 
 
The splint should be padded with cotton or cloths to make it fit softly and snugly 
on the injured forearm. 
 
The splint is best applied over the clothing. 
8. If the broken arm looks deformed or dislocated, do not try to reset it. This might make 
the injury worse and will cause pain. 
9. Do not raise an injured arm to ensure that there is no further damage or increase in 
pain. 
10. Refer the injured to the nearest healthcare facility.

E.9.1 
INJURIES AND FRACTURES OF THE PELVIS 
E.9.1.1 
CAUSES OF PELVIS INJURIES AND FRACTURES 
Pelvis injuries and # FRACTURE fractures are often caused by indirect impact, such as a car crash or by 
crushing, or by fall on hips.  
Pelvis # FRACTURE fractures often are complicated by internal injuries to the tissues and organs located 
inside the pelvis. 
The internal # BLEEDING bleeding caused by the pelvis injury might be severe! 
E.9.1.2

INJURIES AND FRACTURES OF THE LEG (THIGH OR LOWER LEG) OR ANKLE 
E.9.2.1 
CAUSES OF INJURIES AND FACTURES OF THE LEG 
It takes a strong force to # FRACTURE fracture the thigh bone (femur).  
A # FRACTURE fracture of the neck of the thigh bone occurs quite frequently in elderly, mostly as a result of 
a fall. Always assume a # FRACTURE fracture and not a simple bruising in these cases. Deal it as a case of 
# FRACTURE fracture of pelvis. 
Fractures of the thigh bone are a serious injury. There will be # BLEEDING bleeding into the surrounding tissues 
and this might result in # SHOCK shock. The healing of the bone takes long time and is even more 
prolonged in older people.  
Fractures of the lower leg include # FRACTURE fractures of the shin bone (tibia) and the splint bone (fibula). 
Shin bone # FRACTURE fractures are mostly the result of a heavy blow. The splint bone and ankle # FRACTURE fractures 
can result because of twisting of   ankle.

DISLOCATIONS (INJURIES TO JOINTS) 
A dislocation is a displacement of a bone at a joint, like the knee or shoulder. The 
supporting tendons at the joint (the ligaments) might be damaged. 
The response of an injured person to a dislocated limb can be very different.  
If you are not sure whether a bone is dislocated, always seek medical help.  
E.10.1 
 CAUSES OF DISLOCATIONS 
Dislocations are mostly the result of an external force that impacts the body.   
For example: a dislocation of a shoulder can happen by a heavy fall on the hand. A 
dislocation of the jaw can happen due to wide/violent yawning or blows on the chin. 
E.10.2 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
If a person has dislocated bone, you might observe the following signs and symptoms:

E.11 
STRAINS AND SPRAINS (INJURIES TO LIGAMENTS, MUSCLES AND TENDONS) 
A muscle can be strained by overstretching it.  Muscles can also be ruptured (a tear): the 
muscle itself or the tendon is then torn. A sprain is when the ligaments of a joint or the tissues 
surrounding the joint are torn.  
E.11.1 
CAUSES OF STRAINS AND SPRAINS 
Strains might happen as the result of a twist or sudden effort, like lifting a heavy object.  
Sprains might be caused by a sudden wrenching or twisting of the joint. Ankle sprains are quite 
a common example of this.

F.1 
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
 
The nervous system consists of: 
 
the brain, 
 
the spinal cord, and 
 
the nerves. 
Anatomically the nervous system is divided in a central and a peripheral nervous system.  
F.1.1 
THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 
The central nervous system (CNS) comprises of the brain and the spinal cord. 
F.1.1.1 
THE BRAIN 
The brain is an extremely delicate structure made up of a mass of nerve cells. It is here that 
sensations are analysed and orders are given to the muscles.  
The brain is encased in the skull and suspended in a clear fluid, called the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF), which acts as a partial # SHOCK shock absorber. Nonetheless, since the brain is free to move within 
the skull the brain is sensitive to violent movements or pressure.  
The brain has three main structures: 
 
the cerebrum, which is concerned with thought, sensation, and conscious 
movement;      
 
the cerebellum, which coordinates movement, balance, and posture; and  
 
the brain stem, which controls basic functions such as breathing.  


  
146 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
F.1.1.2 
THE SPINAL CORD 
The spinal cord is a mass of nerve fibres extending from the brain through an opening in the 
base of the skull. The cord runs through the spinal column. 
 
The main function of the spinal cord is to convey signals between the brain and the peripheral 
nervous system. 
F.1.2 
THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (PNS) 
The peripheral nerves emerge in pairs, each containing motor and sensory nerves, from the 
brain and spinal cord. Sensory nerves transmit impressions received by the senses (sight, 
hearing, touch etc.) to the brain and motor nerves then transmit the ‘orders’ given by the brain 
to the voluntary muscles. When a nerve is cut there is a loss of feeling, power and movement 
in that part of the body which is controlled by that nerve. 
The peripheral nervous system can be divided in voluntary or somatic nervous system and an 
autonomic nervous system.  
F.1.2.1 
THE SOMATIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 
The somatic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that is responsible for carrying 
motor and sensory information both to and from the central nervous system. This system is made 
up of nerves that connect to the skin, sensory organs and all skeletal muscles. The system is 
responsible for nearly all voluntary muscle movements as well as for processing sensory 
information that arrives via external stimuli including hearing, touch and sight. 
F.1.2.2 
THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 
The autonomic nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates key 
involuntary functions of the body. This system is not controlled by the will and acts continuously 
whether a person is awake or asleep. It controls different body functions including the activity 
of the heart muscle; the smooth muscles, including the muscles of the intestinal tract; and the 
glands. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: the sympathetic nervous system, 
which accelerates the heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and raises blood pressure, and 


  
147 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
the parasympathetic nervous system, which slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland 
activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles. 
 
 


  
148 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
F.2 
UNCONSCIOUSNESS 
Unconsciousness is a state in which the casualty becomes insensible to commands 
because of an interruption to the normal functioning of the brain. A person has perhaps lost 
consciousness if he does not react to your action by opening his eyes or answering your 
questions.  
There is no absolute dividing line between consciousness and un- consciousness. People 
can be fully conscious (aware and awake) or fully # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious (no reaction to any stimulus) 
or at any level between these two extremes. 
Loss of consciousness causes the muscles to relax.  During the period of 
# UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness the tongue might fall backwards and block the breathing passage. 
In fainting, the # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious state is usually brief as in vasovagal syncope.  Fainting can occur 
due to various reasons such as emotional distress, tiredness, hunger, standing up for long 
period, a sudden change in body position, being a long time in a hot environment, or 
specific medical conditions. Pregnant women, children and the elderly can be more 
vulnerable to these causes. 
Longer periods of # UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness are more serious. Causes include head injuries, cardiac 
arrest, stroke or poisoning. 
In an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious state, the person will be unresponsive to your activities (touching, sounds 
or other stimulation). 
Check the following: 
 
Whether the person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions: 
 
“What is your name?” 
 
“Where do you live?” 
 
“How old are you?” 
 
Whether the person responds to simple commands: 
 
“Squeeze my hand.” 
 
“Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.” 
 
If there is no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves. 
If the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious state.  
Note that a person might only partially respond to the stimuli you provide (sound, 
touch, pain); he might be in an in-between state. 
When the person becomes conscious again after a period of # UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness, he might 
suffer from: 
 
confusion, 
 
drowsiness, 
 
light-headedness, 
 
headache, 
 
loss of bowel and bladder control (incontinence), 


  
149 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
fits, and 
 
difficulty speaking. 
The first aider can measure and record a patient's responsiveness and level of consciousness using 
the AVPU scale (see chapter on basic first aid techniques).  
F.2.1 
CAUSES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS 
There are many causes of # UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness and it can occur as a result of a: 
 
head injury resulting in a concussion of the brain or a compression of the brain due 
to swelling or # BLEEDING bleeding; 
 
disturbance of the blood supply to the brain, as in fainting, # SHOCK shock or stroke; 
 
disturbance in the chemical composition of the blood, e.g. lack of oxygen as in 
asphyxia, abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetes or presence of poisonous 
substances in the blood; or 
 
disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain, e.g. as in epilepsy. 
F.2.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
F.2.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP 
1. Make sure there is no danger to you, the person or bystanders. 
F.2.2.2 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
2. Talk loudly to the casualty. Tap him on the shoulders and ask if he is ok.  Do not shake the 
person too roughly. 
3. Check if the casualty is conscious or # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious and act accordingly. 
 
To do so: 
a. Talk loudly to person, shake him gently 
b. Check if the person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions: 
 
‘What is your name?’ 
 
‘Where do you live?’ 
 
‘How old are you?’ 
c. Check if the injured person responds to simple commands: 
 
“Squeeze my hand?” 


  
150 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
“Move your arm/leg/foot/hand” 
d. If there is no response, pinch the person and check if he opens his eyes or 
moves. 
The first aider can measure and record a patient's responsiveness and level of 
consciousness using the AVPU scale (see chapter on basic first aid techniques).  
F.2.2.2.1 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE CASUALTY RESPONDS? 
1. Try not to change the position of the person if there has been a head, neck, back, leg 
or arm injury.   
2. Try to find out what happened to the person. 
3. Tell the person to stay calm and not to move (if at all possible). 
 
4. Look and feel for breathing  
5. Keep checking the casualty to make sure he is not getting worse.   
6. Verify regularly the level of consciousness and breathing. 
7. Find medical help for the person if needed.  
F.2.2.2.2 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE CASUALTY DOES NOT RESPOND? 
1. Try not to change the position of the person if there has been a head, neck, back, leg 
or arm injury.   
 
2. The injured person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do 
not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent 
transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if 
help has been secured. 
3. If you have gloves, put them on.  Do not search for gloves if  not available and continue 
with the next step. 


  
151 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
4. You must unblock the breathing passage: 
a. Gently roll the person over on to his back. 
b .  Carefully tilt his head back and lift the chin up with your hand on the bony part 
of the chin. This simple action lifts the tongue from the back of the throat.  
c .  Do not put your hand on the soft part under the chin to do this! 
 
5. If the person is breathing, put him in the recovery position.   
a. Be careful when moving and turning the victim.  It is better to ask assistance 
by bystanders. 
b. Do not leave the person alone and keep checking his breathing. 
c. Keep the injured person warm by taking off wet clothing, covering him with 
a blanket or other covering, taking care not to overheat him. 
6. If not done yet, arrange transport to a healthcare facility. 
F.2.2.2.3 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON STOPS BREATHING? 
 
 
Perform CPR. 
Do not interrupt the resuscitation until:  
 
the victim starts to wake up, moves, opens his eyes and breathes normally  
 
help (trained in CPR) arrives and takes over; 
 
you become too exhausted to continue; or 
 
the scene becomes unsafe for you to continue. 


  
152 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
F.2.2.2.4 
HYGIENE 
Always wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. 
If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also 
be used, if available. 
F.2.3 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Always urgently transport an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious person to the nearest healthcare facility.  
Anyone who has become # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious or who is feeling sick, has pain after fainting 
(e.g. in the head or heart region, or from trauma resulting from the fall), is on 
medication or is being treated for a medical condition, should always seek medical 
help. 
 
 


  
153 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
F.3 
HEAD INJURIES 
Head injuries can be a concussion, a cerebral compression, or # FRACTURE fracture of the skull. All head 
injuries are potentially serious and require a proper assessment because they can impair 
consciousness.  
Head injuries can be associated with damage to the brain tissue itself, damage to blood vessels 
inside the skull, skull # FRACTURE fractures, brain concussions, and compression of brain tissue because of 
built up pressure due to swelling or # BLEEDING bleeding. 
Assume always that casualty suffering from head injury might also be having a neck or spinal 
injury. 
F.3.1 
CONCUSSION 
A concussion is a ‘shake-up’ of the brain inside the skull. It can be caused by a blow on the 
head or a fall. There is a brief period of impaired consciousness following the blow to the head.  
The casualty might complain of dizziness, headache, blurred vision or nausea. Typically there is 
a brief loss of memory of any events that occurred at the time of, or immediately preceding, 
the injury. 
F.3.2 
CEREBRAL COMPRESSION  
Some head injuries may produce a compression of brain tissue.  The pressure inside the skull 
builds up by swelling or # BLEEDING bleeding inside the skull.  This condition is life threatening.  
Casualties show a deteriorating level of consciousness that may progress to # UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness. 
Therefore, it is important to observe continuously the conscious level of a casualty that 
experienced a head trauma. 
Other signs and symptoms you may observe are:  
 
The person complains of an intense headache. 
 
The person complains of dizziness. 
 
The person complains of drowsiness. 
 
The person complains of blurred or double vision 
 
The breathing gets noisy and becomes slow. 
 
A slow but strong pulse (can be felt if the first aider is experienced in the technique 
of taking the pulse). 
 
Unequal pupil size. 
 
Weakness and/or paralysis on one side of the face and/or body. 
 
A change in the behaviour or the personality of the casualty. 
F.3.3 
SKULL FRACTURES 
If the casualty has a head wound or bruise, be alert for a possible skull # FRACTURE fracture also.  A skull 
# FRACTURE fracture is a serious condition because of the underlying risk of brain damage and # BLEEDING bleeding. 
You might observe following signs and symptoms: 
 
There is a soft area or a depression on the scalp. 


  
154 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Asymmetry of the head or skull. 
 
There is bruising or swelling behind the ear(s). 
 
Clear watery fluid (CSF) or blood is leaking from the casualty’s ear or nose. 
 
The casualty has a deteriorating level of response which may progress to 
# UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness. 
F.3.4 
WHAT DO I DO? 
1. Approach a casualty who experienced a period of impaired consciousness as 
described in the chapter on # UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness. 
 
2. If there is a risk of # FRACTURE fractures of the skull, neck or spine: treat the casualty accordingly 
as described in the chapter on injuries and # FRACTURE fractures to the head, neck and spine. 
If there is a risk of # FRACTURE fractures of the skull, neck or spine, treat the casualty accordingly 
(see chapter on Injuries and # FRACTURE fractures to the head, neck and spine). 
F.3.5 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Always urgently transport an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious casualty to the nearest healthcare facility. 
Injured people suspected of having head, neck or spinal injuries should always be 
examined urgently in the nearest healthcare facility.  
Anyone who has become # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious or who is feeling sick, has pain after fainting 
(e.g. in the head or heart region, or from trauma resulting from the fall), is on 
medication or is being treated for a medical condition, should always visit the 
healthcare facility for medical check. 
 
 


  
155 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
F.4 
 STROKE 
‘Stroke’ is a rapid loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. 
It can be the result of # BLEEDING bleeding or when a blood clot leads to a blockage in a blood vessel to 
the brain, blocking the blood flow. As a result the affected brain part can’t function normally 
and this might result in difficulty in moving, speaking, understanding, etc. Symptoms occur 
suddenly and depend on the area of the brain affected. 
Strokes occur commonly in later life and in patients that suffer high blood pressure or other 
circulatory disorder 
F.4.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You might observe following signs and symptoms: 
 
The person complains of numbness; 
 
The person complains of blurred vision; 
 
The person talks with a slurred speech; 
 
The person complains of severe headache; 
 
The person seems confused; 
 
You may observe: 
 
weakness or paralysis of the limbs, 
 
weakness or paralysis in the face. 
 
Sometimes the person might even have loss of consciousness. 
The possibility of stroke should always be considered when there is: 
 
a sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of 
the body; and/or  
 
a sudden trouble in speaking, seeing or understanding. 
F.4.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
1. If you think someone is suffering from a stroke, you can ask the person to perform 
three simple actions to check. 
You can easily remember this via the mnemonic ‘FAST’: Face – Arm – Speech and 
Transport. 
 
 


  
156 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
F 
2. Ask the person to smile or to show his teeth. 
Check whether the mouth is crooked or drooping at one corner. 
There might be saliva dribbling out of the mouth. 
A 
3. Ask the person to lift both arms. 
Check whether he can do this without one arm dropping or drifting. Can he do this? 
Is one arm lower than the other? 
A stroke often causes one side of the body to become weak or even paralyzed. 
The person might also have lost his balance. 
 
S 
4. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence after you. Check whether he can speak 
clearly or if he has problems in saying the words. 


  
157 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
A stroke is very likely if the person has difficulties with any of the above actions. 
T 
5. Arrange transport quickly.  The earlier the person is treated, the better is the 
outcome. Try to find out when the problem started, note it down and report it. 
6. If you think the person suffers from a stroke, the person urgently needs help. Shout 
or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a 
bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare 
facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured. 
7. If the person can sit up, make him to sit upright. This helps the person to breathe. 
If the person cannot sit up, place him in the recovery position.  
8. Comfort the person and explain what is happening. Tell the person to relax and rest. 
9. He should not try to do anything. 
10. Do not give food or drink to the person having a stroke. There is an increased risk of 
# CHOKING choking or vomiting. 
11. Keep checking that the person is awake and breathing properly. 
12. Arrange urgent transport to a healthcare facility. 
13. Always wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash 
your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-
based sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
F.4.2.1 
WHAT DO I DO IF THE PERSON IS UNCONSCIOUS, BUT IS STILL BREATHING? 
a. Put the person in the recovery position.  
b. Continue to observe the victim and check his breathing 
F.4.3 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON STOPS BREATHING? 
Start CPR. 
Do not interrupt the resuscitation until:  
 
the person starts to wake up, moves, opens his eyes and breathes normally;  
 
help (trained on  CPR) arrives and takes over; 
 
you become too exhausted to continue; or 
 
the area becomes unsafe for you to continue. 


  
158

F.4.4 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Always arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility. This should be 
done even if the symptoms improve.

F.5 
FITS – CONVULSIONS - SEIZURES 
A person has a fit (a seizure or convulsions) if he suddenly shakes uncontrollably. It is 
different from normal shivering and trembling. It may manifest in all limbs or just be limited to a 
single limb. 
The person having the fit may urinate and defecate without control. A fit can be caused by high 
fever, diseases (e.g. malaria, epilepsy…), poisoning (e.g. alcohol, drugs…) or a trauma (e.g. 
brain injury). 
Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder (neurological disorder) in which nerve cell activity 
in the brain becomes disrupted, causing seizures or periods of unusual behaviour, sensations 
and sometimes loss of consciousness. Epilepsy is usually a disease of the young. In the beginning 
the frequency of convulsions is usually less, but they become more and more frequent later. 
Epilepsy seizures may be of a ‘minor’ or ‘major’ kind. In minor epilepsy seizures, the casualty 
becomes pale, his eyes become fixed and staring and he becomes # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious for a few 
seconds. He resumes his work soon as though nothing had happened. A major epilepsy seizure 
(also known as ‘grand mal seizures’) is serious.  The attack follows a headache, restlessness or 
a feeling of dullness. The casualty is usually aware that he is going to get an attack of an 
epileptic fit. 
Children under the age of four often develop fits as a result of high temperature (fever) caused 
by infectious diseases.  A child having a fit should be brought to a nearby healthcare facility for 
urgent examination by a doctor. 
F.5.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You may observe following signs and symptoms: 
 
sudden uncontrollable shaking; 
 
falling down on the floor; 
 
loss of consciousness; 
 
foaming at the mouth; or 
 
the person might have earlier mentioned that he smelled, felt, tasted, heard or saw 
things differently. 
If the fit is due to high temperature (fever): 
 
the skin might then feel hot and look reddish. 
F.5.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
F.5.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST 
1. Make sure there is no danger to you, the person or bystanders.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
F.5.2.2 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
 
 
2. Remove objects that could hurt the person. 
 
3. Do not hold the person down (do not restrain the person). 
 
4. If possible, put something soft (cushion, clothing) under the head if the person is lying 
on the floor. 
 
5. Make sure the person can breathe freely by loosening tight clothing around the 
neck (collar, tie). 


  
161 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
 
6. Do not put anything into the person’s mouth. 
 
7. Do not put your fingers in the person’s mouth.  
A person cannot swallow his saliva  during a convulsion. A person might bite his own tongue, 
but this normally heals in a few days. 
An object or a hand placed in the mouth of someone having a convulsion is 
dangerous for the victim and yourself. 
8. For a child with high fever: 
a. Remove clothing and blankets and ensure there is enough fresh air. 
b. Do not make the child too cold. 
c. Put pillows and soft padding around the child so that he cannot hurt himself. 
d. If possible, put the child in the recovery position. 
e. Sponge the child with water at room temperature.  
 
 


  
162 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
9. When the fit stops: put the person in the recovery position if he is not yet in this position.  
This will keep the breathing passage open and prevent vomit from entering the lungs. 
10. Stay with the person till he gets better. 
11. Reassure the person, parents and bystanders. 
12. Do not give food or drinks to a child or person that has just had a fit. 
13. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility  if: 
a. The person has high fever. 
b. The person did not wake up between fits.  
c. The person stopped breathing, or the situation worsens. 
d. This was the person’s first fit (and he has no fever). 
e. The person is under influence of drugs or alcohol. 
F.5.2.3 
HYGIENE 
Always wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. 
If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also 
be used, if available. 
F.5.3 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Always arrange urgent transport t o  the nearest healthcare facility if the person has 
more than one fit and he did not wake up in between; the person has high fever, or the 
person’s condition deteriorates further. 
Always refer the person who has suffered a fit to a healthcare facility for further 
treatment.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
G.1 
GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 
Water and food are essential for the survival of the human body. The unique structure of the 
gastrointestinal tract (GI) allows it to perform its specialized functions to turn food into the 
energy for survival and packaging the residue for waste disposal.           
 
Mouth 
The mouth or oral cavity is the beginning of the digestive tract. In fact, digestion starts here 
when taking the first bite of food. Chewing breaks the food into pieces that are more easily 
digested, while saliva mixes with food to begin the process of breaking it down into a form 
the body can absorb and use. 
 
Oesophagus 
Located in throat cavity near your trachea (windpipe), the gullet, also called oesophagus, 
receives food from the mouth when swallowing. By means of a series of muscular 
contractions, the oesophagus delivers food to the stomach. 
 
Stomach 
The stomach is a hollow organ that holds food while it is being mixed with enzymes that 
continue the process of breaking down food into a usable form. Cells in the lining of the 
stomach secrete strong acid and powerful enzymes that are responsible for the 
breakdown process. When the contents of the stomach are sufficiently processed, they 
are released into the small intestine. 
 
 


  
165 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Small intestine 
Made up of three segments — the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum — the small intestine is 
an approximately 7 meter (app. 22.5 foot) long muscular tube that breaks down food using 
enzymes released by the pancreas and bile from the liver. Peristalsis also is at work in this 
organ, moving food through and mixing it with digestive secretions from the pancreas and 
liver. The duodenum is largely responsible for the continuous breaking-down process, with 
the jejunum and ileum mainly responsible for absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream. 
Contents of the small intestine start out semi-solid, digested on the way and end in a more 
liquid form after passing through the organ. Water, bile, enzymes, and mucous contribute 
to the change in consistency. Once the nutrients have been absorbed and the leftover-
food residue liquid has passed through the small intestine, it then moves on to the large 
intestine, or colon. 
 
Pancreas 
The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum, the first segment of the small 
intestine. These enzymes break down protein, fats, and carbohydrates. The pancreas also 
makes insulin, secreting it directly into the bloodstream. Insulin is the chief hormone for 
metabolizing sugar. 
 
Liver 
The liver has multiple functions, but its main function within the digestive system is to process 
the nutrients absorbed from the small intestine. Bile from the gall bladder (liver) secreted 
into the small intestine also plays an important role in digesting fat. In addition, the liver is 
the body’s “chemical factory." It takes the raw materials absorbed by the intestine and 
makes all the various chemicals the body needs to function. The liver also detoxifies 
potentially harmful substances. It breaks down and secretes many substances. 
 
Gallbladder 
The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, and then releases it into the duodenum to 
help absorb and digest fats. 
 


  
166 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Large intestine (colon) 
The colon is an approximately 1.5 meter (app. 60 inches) long muscular tube that connects 
the small intestine to the rectum. The large intestine is made up of the cecum, the 
ascending (right) colon, the transverse (across) colon, the descending (left) colon, and 
the sigmoid colon, which connects to the rectum. The appendix is a small tube attached 
to the cecum. The large intestine is a highly specialized organ that is responsible for 
processing waste so that emptying the bowels is easy and convenient. 
Stool, or waste left over from the digestive process, is passed through the colon by means 
of peristalsis, first in a liquid state and ultimately in a semi-solid/solid form. As stool passes 
through the colon, water is removed. Stool is stored in the sigmoid (S-shaped) colon until a 
"mass movement" empties it into the rectum once or twice a day. It normally takes about 
36 hours for stool to get through the colon. The stool itself is mostly food debris and bacteria. 
These bacteria perform several useful functions, such as synthesizing various vitamins, 
processing waste products and food particles, and protecting against harmful bacteria. 
When the descending colon becomes full of stool, also called faeces, it empties its 
contents into the rectum to begin the process of elimination.

The rectum is 18 to 20 cm (app. 8-inch) chamber that connects the colon to the anus. It is 
the rectum's job to receive stool from the colon, to let the person know that there is stool 
to be evacuated, and to hold the stool until evacuation happens. When anything (gas or 
stool) comes into the rectum, sensors send a message to the brain. The brain then decides 
if the rectal contents can be released or not. If they can, the sphincters relax and the 
rectum contracts, disposing of its contents. If the contents cannot be disposed of, the 
sphincter contracts and the rectum accommodates so that the sensation temporarily 
goes away. 
 
Anus 
The anus is the last part of the digestive tract. It is a 3 to 5 cm (app 2-inch) long canal 
consisting of the pelvic floor muscles and the two anal sphincters (internal and external). 
The lining of the upper anus is specialized to detect rectal contents. It lets the person know 
whether the contents are liquid, gas, or solid. The anus is surrounded by sphincter muscles 
that are important in allowing control of stool movement. The pelvic floor muscles create 


  
167 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
an angle between the rectum and the anus that stops stool from coming out when it is not 
supposed to. The internal sphincter is always tight, except when stool enters the rectum. It 
keeps us continent when we are asleep or otherwise unaware of the presence of stool. 
When we get an urge to go to the bathroom, we rely on our external sphincter to hold the 
stool until reaching a toilet, where it then relaxes to release the contents. 
A well balanced diet contains carbohydrates, proteins, fat, minerals (ea. iron, calcium, 
sodium, potassium, magnesium, fluorine, iodine, zinc, copper etc.) and vitamins.

DIARRHOEA 
Diarrhoea is the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently 
than is normal for the individual. It is usually a symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which 
can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. 
A person can catch this infection by: 
 
drinking contaminated water; 
 
preparing food with contaminated water; 
 
eating unsafe food, such as fish that was caught in polluted water; 
 
food that has not been kept cold or has gone bad;  
 
touching faeces; or 
 
not washing his hands. 
Diarrhoea causes dehydration as too much water and nutrition leaves the body. If the sick 
person does not receive help, he can die. Babies and children are most at risk of dehydration. 
If both fever and diarrhoea occur together, laypersons often focus on fever only and not 
enough attention is paid to replacing lost fluids due to diarrhoea. 
A sick person with diarrhoea does not normally need antibiotics, unless prescribed by a 
doctor. 
G.2.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You may observe following signs and symptoms: 
 
The sick person has frequent loose or liquid stools. 
 
The sick person has an urgent need to defecate and might have trouble to keep it 
under control. Even after defecation person may complain of feeling of incomplete 
evacuation. 
 
Often the sick person complains about pain in the abdomen (cramps). 
 
The abdomen might appear bloated or tense. 
 
The sick person complains of feeling unwell. 
 
Fever might be present. 
 
There might be nausea and/or vomiting. 
 
The sick person might be passing blood and/or mucus in stool. 
G.2.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
G.2.2.1 
HYGIENE 
1. Wash your hands before taking care of the sick person. Use soap and water to wash 
your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-
based sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
2. Use gloves to protect yourself. If no gloves are available, you can use a clean 
plastic bag. 


  
169 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Try not to come in contact with the person’s stool or vomit. 
G.2.3 
PREVENT DEHYDRATION 
  
3. Prevent dehydration by giving plenty of fluids to the sick person. Ask the sick person to 
drink the equivalent of what he lost every time he passes loose stools: 
On an average, a person should drink 5-10 ml/kg body weight per loose stool. 
 
a. Children under two years old should drink between a quarter and half of a 
large cup (50-100 ml) each time they pass loose stools. 
 
b. Children between 2-10 years should drink between a half and a full large cup 
(100-200 ml) each time they pass loose stools. 


  
170 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
c. Children above ten years and adults should at least drink one large cup (200 
ml) each time they pass loose stools. 
 
d. Feed the sick child more frequently. 
Tell the mother to continue to give breast feeding with a higher frequency.  
Tell the mother to continue to give bottle feeding (for bottle-fed children only) 
with a higher frequency. Use the same milk as usual. 
 
4. Advice the sick person to avoid fruit juices. 
 
5. Let the sick person drink (if available) ORS (package bought at chemist or available 
at Govt. healthcare facilities free of cost). 


  
171 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Prepare and use as instructed on package.  
 
6. If no ORS is available, you can prepare a homemade sugar and salt solution:  
a. Take one litre of safe clean water (boiled and cooled clean water). 
b. Add eight teaspoons of sugar. 
c. Add one teaspoon of salt. 
d. Mix well. 
7. If the sick person also vomits, wait five to ten minutes before giving another drink. Then 
ask the person to drink slowly or give it by spoon. 
 
8. You may give the sick person curd (if available). 
9. The sick person can eat light food. 
10. If a person has to travel, provide drinks so that he can take in fluids on the way. 
11. Advise for regularly check on the sick person and to seek medical help if his 
condition worsens. This includes passing blood and mucus in stool, having fever, 
developing dehydration, or if diarrhoea does not get better within 2 days. 
G.2.3.1 
HYGIENE 
Wash your hands after taking care of the sick person or if you came into contact with stools or 
vomit or you used the toilet. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, 
you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
G.3 
FOOD POISONING 
Usually people loosely refer to all cases of gastroenteritis (vomiting, diarrhoea) caused by 
contaminated food as having food poisoning. Infectious organisms including viruses, bacteria 
and parasites are the most common causes of food poisoning. Contamination can occur at 
any point of production, processing, handling, storage, or cooking. The person may become 
sick in a few hours to several days after eating the contaminated food. These cases can be 
managed as other cases of diarrhoea. 
Sometimes, food is directly contaminated by toxins, for example toxins released by 
Staphylococci or Clostridium bacteria. In such cases, the person usually becomes unwell very 
soon after consuming the food and the main symptom is vomiting. Some consider cases 
caused by food contaminated by a toxin as having true food poisoning. These cases need to 
be referred to the hospital urgently for proper management. 
G.3.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You may observe following signs and symptoms: 
 
The sick person has nausea or vomits.

DIABETES 
Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become high. 
Many people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be 
diagnosed as having diabetes. This condition is sometimes referred to as ‘pre-diabetes’. If the 
blood sugar level is above the normal range, the risk of developing ‘full-blown’ diabetes is 
increased.  
There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. 
G.4.1 
TYPE 1 DIABETES 
In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce 
insulin. As no insulin is produced, the glucose level increases, which can seriously damage the 
body's organs. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for the rest of their 
life. 
Type 1 diabetes is often known as insulin-dependent diabetes. It's also sometimes known 
as juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes when it develops in young persons, often during 
the teenage years.  
Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes.  
G.4.2 
TYPE 2 DIABETES 
Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't 
respond to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance. 
Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1 diabetes.  
People diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may be able to control the symptoms simply by eating 
a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring their blood glucose levels frequently. 
However, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 
may eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets and/or injections. 
Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity. It is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset 
diabetes because it's more common in older people. 
G.4.3 
GESTATIONAL DIABETES (DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY) 
During pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is 
unable to produce enough insulin to convert it into energy. This is known as gestational 
diabetes. 
Pregnancy can also make existing type 1 diabetes worse. Gestational diabetes can increase 
the risk of health problems developing in an unborn baby, so it's important to keep the 
blood glucose levels under control. 
In most cases, gestational diabetes develops during the second trimester of pregnancy (weeks 
14 to 26) and usually disappears after the baby is born. However, women who have gestational 
diabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.  
 
 


  
177 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
G.4.4 
DIAGNOSIS 
It is very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get 
progressively worse if left untreated. Symptoms such as feeling thirsty, hungry and passing urine 
more often than usual, losing weight and muscle bulk, having wounds that heal slowly, 
experiencing blurred vision or feeling tired all the time might indicate a person suffers from 
diabetes and this person should contact a healthcare facility. 
 
 


  
178 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
G.5 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA 
A too high level of blood sugar, called hyperglycaemia occurs when the body can't remove 
glucose from the blood and turn it into energy. It usually only happens in people with diabetes 
because people with this condition have problems with insulin – the hormone that helps 
remove glucose from the blood and converts it to energy. 
If you have diabetes, there are some situations that can trigger an increase in blood glucose 
including infections, stress, missing a dose of insulin, eating too much or being ill. 
G.5.1 
SYMPTOMS OF HYPERGLYCAEMIC COMA OR DIABETIC COMA 
Immediate medical attention is required if a person with diabetes, experiences the following 
symptoms: 
 
nausea or vomiting;  
 
stomach pain; 
 
a fruity smell on the breath, which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish; 
 
drowsiness or confusion; 
 
rapid breathing (hyperventilation); 
 
signs of dehydration (signs of which include a headache, dry skin, and a weak, 
rapid heartbeat); 
 
loss of consciousness. 
These symptoms may be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious and potentially life-
threatening complication of hyperglycaemia.

if help has been secured. 
3. Make the person lie down in a comfortable position. 
 


  
179 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
4. Ask if the person is taking medicines for diabetes. If so, allow the person to take the 
prescribed medication. 
5. Arrange urgent transport to a nearby healthcare facility. 
6. Keep observing the person in case he collapses.

G.6 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Hypoglycaemia, or also known as a "hypo", is an abnormally low level of sugar (glucose) in 
the blood. When the glucose level is too low, the body doesn't have enough energy to carry 
out its activities. 
Hypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with diabetes and mainly occurs if someone 
with diabetes taking too much insulin (overdoses insulin) or other medicines, missing a meal or 
exercises too hard. 
People who do not have diabetes can also experience hypoglycaemia, although this is much 
rarer. It can be triggered by malnutrition, binge drinking or certain other conditions. 
G.6.1 
SYMPTOMS OF HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Most people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives 
them time to correct them. Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or 
shakiness, dizziness, and sweating.  
In more severe cases, there can also be confusion and difficulty in concentration. In severe 
cases, the person experiencing hypoglycaemia may lose consciousness. 
It is also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, 
disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking. 
G.6.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
G.6.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST 
1. Make sure there is no danger to you, the person or bystanders. 
G.6.2.2 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
2. Make the person lie down in a comfortable position. 
3. Ask if the person is taking insulin and/or other medicines for diabetes and if he might 
have taken too much insulin and/or other medicines, missed a meal or have done 
a heavy physical exercise. 
 
4. If the person is conscious and is able to follow commands and can swallow, give the 
sick person some food or drink that contains sugar, such as sweets, jam, or dextrose 
tablets or fruit juice. 
Often the diabetic patient has fast acting sugars such as biscuits available with them. 
Allow him to take it. 


  
181 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
After having something sugary, suggest the person to have a longer-acting 
"starchy" carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits or a sandwich. 
5. Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who is drowsy or 
# UNCONSCIOUS unconscious, as he could choke 
6. Keep observing the person in case he collapses. 
7. If you cannot differentiate between hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia (which 
is difficult even for a trained person), treat the patient as having hypoglycaemia. 
Low blood sugar can kill a person quickly. 
G.6.2.2.1 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON BECOMES UNCONSCIOUS, BUT IS STILL BREATHING? 
a. Put the person in the recovery position. 
b. Continue to observe the patient’s condition and breathing.

HYGIENE 
Always wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. 
If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also 
be used, if available. 
G.6.3 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Always arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility as a diabetic coma is 
a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.   
If the diabetic person experienced hypoglycaemia but improved with oral sugar, he 
should contact the healthcare facility to review his condition and eventually to correct 
his insulin doses and other medications.

H.1 
THE SKIN  
Skin is the largest organ on our body, made up of several different components including water, 
protein, lipids and different minerals and chemicals.  
Throughout life the skin changes and regenerates itself approximately every 27 days.  
Proper care and treatment is essential for maintaining the health and vitality of this crucial 
protection. 
 
 
The skin consists of three layers: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. 
H.1.1 
THE OUTER LAYER: EPIDERMIS 
It’s the thinnest layer, but it’s responsible for protecting you from the harsh environment, with 
five layers of its own: stratum germinativum, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum 
lucidum, and stratum corneum.  
The epidermis also hosts different types of cells: keratinocytes, melanocytes and Langerhans 
cells. Keratinocytes produce the protein known as keratin, the main component of the 
epidermis. Melanocytes produce the skin pigment, known as melanin. Langerhans cells 
prevent things from getting into the skin. 
H.1.2 
THE MIDDLE LAYER: DERMIS 
The dermis is a complex combination of blood vessels, hair follicles, and sebaceous (oil) glands. 
Here, you’ll find collagen and elastin, two proteins offering the skin’s support and elasticity. 
Fibroblasts are the cells that synthesize collagen and elastin.  
This layer also contains pain and touch receptors.  
It is this layer that is responsible for wrinkles. 
H.1.3 
THE FATTY LAYER: HYPODERMIS 
This layer is also known as the subcutis.  
It hosts sweat glands, and fat and collagen cells, and is responsible for conserving your body’s 
heat and protecting your vital inner organs.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
H.2 
SKIN FUNCTIONS 
The main functions of the skin are protection, sensation, temperature regulation, immunity, 
allowing movement and growth, excretion and synthesis of vitamins. 
H.2.1 
PROTECTION 
The skin is a natural barrier between the inside of the body and its surrounding environment. 
The skin protects against dehydration, UV light, microorganisms and physical trauma. 
H.2.2 
SENSATION 
The pain and touch receptors in the dermis allow us to feel touch, pressure, heat, cold and 
pain. 
H.2.3 
TEMPERATURE REGULATION 
The optimal temperature for the human body is 36 to 37 degrees Celsius (or 97 to 99 degrees 
Fahrenheit). A section of the brain called the hypothalamus controls the body’s 
thermoregulation. It issues instructions to muscles, organs, glands, and nervous system when it 
senses the core internal temperature is becoming too low or too high.  
One of the major functions of the skin is to help to maintain the body temperature. 
H.2.3.1.1 
HOW THE SKIN HELPS TO KEEP THE BODY WARM? 
When the body becomes too cold, blood vessels at the body’s skin surface narrow (constrict) 
to keep the warm blood in the core of the body. The activity of the sweat glands in the skin is 
reduced and the hairs stand on end to keep warm air close to the skin. Shivering is a method 
to generate heat by involuntary muscle activity. 
H.2.3.1.2 
HOW THE SKIN HELPS TO KEEP THE BODY COLD? 
When the body becomes too hot, blood vessels at the body’s skin surface widen (dilate) to 
loose heat by the increased blood flow. The activity of the sweat glands in the skin is turned up 
to create more sweat, which cools down the skin as it evaporates.  
H.2.4 
IMMUNITY 
Several types of skin cells (e.g. Langerhans cells, phagocytic cells, epidermal dendritic cells) 
are responsible for the destruction of microorganisms or are involved in the interaction of the 
skin with the body's immune system. 
H.2.5 
ALLOWS GROWTH AND MOVEMENT 
The elasticity of the skin allows growth, movement and adaptation of the contours of the body 
during movement. 
H.2.6 
EXCRETION 
The body releases waste products from the body via the surface of the skin, regulated by the 
volume and composition of sweat (e.g. excretion of water, urea, ammonia and uric acid). 
H.2.7 
SYNTHESIS OF VITAMINS 
The skin plays an important role in the synthesis of vitamin D.

BURN WOUNDS 
Burns are injuries to the skin and underlying tissue that result from the sun, heat sources, fire, 
hot items, boiling liquids, chemicals, irradiation, etc. However, cold can also create burn 
wounds! 
H.3.1 
FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD DEGREE BURNS 
Burns are classified by the degree of skin and underlying tissues that are damaged. You will 
observe different signs and symptoms according to the severity of the burn wound. 
H.3.1.1 
 FIRST DEGREE BURNS 
 
Superficial first degree # BURNS burns show following signs and symptoms: 
 
red or darker than usual skin; 
 
slightly swollen skin; 
 
painful, but mostly bearable. 
These # BURNS burns usually extend only into the epidermis. 
H.3.1.2 
 SECOND DEGREE BURNS 
 
Intermediate second degree # BURNS burns show following signs and symptoms: 
 
blistering, 
 
swelling, 
 
very painful. 
These # BURNS burns usually involve the epidermis and the dermis. 
 


  
186 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
H.3.1.3 
THIRD DEGREE BURNS 
 
Deep third degree # BURNS burns show following signs and symptoms 
 
black, parchment-like or white-looking burn wound; 
 
mostly dry; 
 
no pain inside the third degree area, but very painful in the surrounding second 
and first degree burned parts of the skin. 
H.3.2 
TYPE OF BURNS BY ORIGIN 
Burns can be differentiated by their origin: 
H.3.2.1 
DRY BURNS 
Dry # BURNS burns are # BURNS burns from flames, contacts with hot objects (e.g. hot cigarettes, hot domestic 
appliances) or friction (e.g. rope # BURNS burns). 
H.3.2.2 
SCALDS 
Scalds are # BURNS burns by steam or hot liquids (e.g. tea, coffee, hot fat). 
H.3.2.3 
ELECTRICAL BURNS 
Electrical # BURNS burns are # BURNS burns caused by electrical current. These # BURNS burns can result from low voltage 
current (e.g. home appliances) or high voltage current (e.g. transformers) or by lightning strikes. 
H.3.2.4 
CHEMICAL BURNS 
Exposure to chemical substances like industrial chemicals, corrosive gases or inhaled chemical 
fumes can cause chemical # BURNS burns. Also, the exposure to domestic chemicals and agents as 
paint stripper, caustic soda, weed killers, bleach, oven cleaners or strong acids or alkali can 
cause # BURNS burns. 
H.3.2.5 
RADIATION BURNS 
Exposure to radioactive sources, e.g. X-rays or radiotherapy-rays, can result in radiation # BURNS burns. 
H.3.2.6 
FROST BITES (COLD BURNS) 
Cold # BURNS burns like frost bites originate from exposure to cold wind, cold temperature or contact 
with cold freezing materials (e.g. cold metal), or can happen from contact with freezing 
vapours (e.g. liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen).

TITLE OF CHAPTER
H.3.2.7 
SUN BURNS 
Intensive exposure to sunlight, an over-exposure to ultraviolet light (UV) from a sunlamp or the 
sun result in sun # BURNS burns. 
Long exposure to heat or hot weather can also lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke. 
H.3.3 
DANGER OF BURNS 
Severe or large burn injuries can pose serious problems. However, any burn injury can lead to 
complications. 
The danger from # BURNS burns usually depends more on the area of the # BURNS burns rather than the degree. 
Superficial # BURNS burns over a large area of the body are more dangerous than the complete 
charring of a part of the limb. It must be noted that a burn is mostly a mixture itself of different 
degrees of # BURNS burns, and that in the same person different degrees of # BURNS burns may show on different 
parts of the body.  
The most important dangers are: 
 
Infection 
Burn injuries leave the skin open and susceptible to infection. Burn injuries also increase 
your risk of sepsis, which is a life- threatening infection that rapidly travels through the 
bloodstream. Sepsis can cause # SHOCK shock and organ failure. 
 
Low blood volume 
Burn injuries damage the skin and the blood vessels, causing fluids to escape the body. 
This can result in low blood volume, known as hypovolemia. A severe loss of fluid and blood 
can prevent the heart from pumping enough blood through the body (resulting in # SHOCK shock). 
 
Low body temperature 
The skin helps to control the body's temperature. When a large portion of the skin is injured, 
the body loses heat. This increases the risk of hypothermia — i.e. when the body loses heat 
faster than it can produce – resulting in a dangerously low body temperature. 
 
Breathing difficulties 
One of the most common dangers that accompany burn injuries is the inhalation of smoke 
or hot air. This can burn the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Smoke can permanently 
damage the lungs and lead to respiratory failure. 
 
Pain 
Burn wounds are very painful.  
 
Disability 
Burn injuries form scar tissue once healed. When the skin is burned, the surrounding skin 
starts to pull together resulting in a post-burn contracture that prevents movement. Deeper 
# BURNS burns can limit movement of the bones or joints when skin, muscles or tendons shorten and 
tighten, permanently pulling joints out of position.

H.3.4.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
H.3.4.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST AND SEEK HELP 
1. Make sure the situation is safe for yourself and (if possible) for the victim. 
2. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a 
bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility 
or hospital. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured. 
H.3.4.2.2 
RESCUING A PERSON FROM A FIRE: 
The fire brigade is equipped and trained to rescue people from fires. It is their duty and 
is not the primary duty of a first aider. However, in the exceptional case you need to 
rescue a person from a fire yourself, follow these guidelines: 
3. Make sure you have already called for help prior entering the location. 
4. Have a wet handkerchief/cloth around your face. Crawl along the floor to reach 
and pull out the casualty as most clean air will be at lower level. 
5. Act swiftly and quickly because there might be some amount of carbon monoxide 
also in the room. A wet handkerchief and crawling on the floor will not protect you 
from it.  
6. Do not open other doors or windows when there is fire in the room. The rush of air 
will increase the fire.

H.3.7 
ELECTRICAL BURNS AND ELECTROCUTION BY ELECTRICITY OR LIGHTNING 
Electrical # BURNS burns are caused when electricity passes through the body.  
The electricity source may be e.g. lightning or contact with household current, high voltage 
cables or transformers, or low voltage - high ampere electricity from a car, truck or tractor 
battery. Do not touch the casualty till the power switch has been turned off. 
The electricity enters the body at the point of contact, goes through the body and exits at the 
point where the body touches the ground or at earth point. Often burn wounds may be 
observed at these entry and exit points. But inside the body the electricity can cause damage 
on its track that remains hidden.  
Exposure to electricity can also cause cardiac arrest. 
H.3.7.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
Following signs and symptoms might be observed: 
 
Based on the situation you may be able to detect there has been an electrocution 
accident (e.g. you notice an electrical appliance connected to the electrical net 
next to the casualty, a high voltage wire might be next to the casualty, 
thunderstorm, …). 
 
The casualty may: 
 
be # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious, 
 
have difficulty in breathing or have stopped breathing, 
 
be in cardiac arrest (no beating heart) or have an irregular pulse, 
 
have burn wounds, or

SUNBURNS, SNOW/WELDERS EYES, HEAT EXHAUSTION AND HEAT STROKE 
H.3.9.1 
SUNBURNS 
Direct exposure to sunlight can have ill effects on the skin and eyes.   
The injury to the skin is known as "sunburn". It is caused by the exposure to ultraviolet rays from 
the sun. When UV B rays penetrate the deeper skin layers damage to the cells occurs. The skin 
becomes red and painful. In some cases the damage to the cells is so severe resulting in skin 
peeling and blistering. 
Strong or cool wind or a body covered by water or sweat might give the sunbathing person a 
falsely reassuring effect of not being sunburned. As clouds have less limiting effect on UV 
radiation than they do on temperature, sun# BURNS burns still can happen on cloudy days. White 
surfaces such as snow or sand reflect UV radiation and so increase the risk of sunburn. Rippling 
water and rough sea reflect more UV radiation than calm open water. Sunlight has a shorter 
distance to travel in order to reach the earth’s surface in areas closer to the tropics; UV 
radiation levels will therefore, be higher in these areas because there is less dissipation of the 
rays as they travel to earth. The level of UV radiation also increases with altitude as the 
atmosphere becomes thinner and there is less absorption of the radiation.  
H.3.9.1.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
Following signs and symptoms may be observed when a person suffers a sunburn: 
 
reddened skin, 
 
warm skin, and 
 
pain of varying degrees.  
In more severe cases:

2. Cool down the skin by sponging or by slowly showering for about 10-15 minutes.  Be 
careful not to overcool the casualty: do not use too cold water.  
 
3. Encourage the casualty to have frequent sips of cool water (this is an exception to 
the standard first aid guideline of not giving a casualty to drink or to eat). 
4. For severe # BURNS burns, refer the casualty to the nearest healthcare facility. 
For minor # BURNS burns, an after-sun cream may be applied. 
5. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available.

SUNBURN OF THE EYE AND SNOW OR WELDERS BLINDNESS 
Snow blindness or sunburn of the eye (also known as photokeratitis or ultraviolet keratitis) is a 
painful eye condition caused by exposure of insufficiently protected eyes to the ultraviolet 
rays. Common causes are looking into welding light without eye protection; exposure to 
sunlight reflected from snow and ice without wearing sun glasses, or looking directly into 
sunlight (e.g. looking at a solar eclipse) without using the appropriate protection.

HEATSTROKE 
Normally the body dissipate the heat with the help of sweat glands.   
In some cases the body may not be able to dissipate the heat by sweating and the body 
temperature rises, sometimes up to 41.1 C (106 F) or higher. Or a dehydrated person may not 
be able to sweat fast enough to dissipate heat, which causes the body temperature to rise. 
Heat regulation mechanism fails during heatstroke. 
Heatstroke is a form of hyperthermia, an abnormally elevated body temperature with 
accompanying physical and neurological symptoms. Heatstroke is a true medical emergency 
that can be fatal if not properly and promptly treated. Most susceptible to heat strokes are 
infants and the elderly.  
H.5.1

H.6 
FROSTBITES 
Frostbite is damage to skin and tissues caused by exposure to freezing temperatures – typically 
any temperature below minus 0.55ºC (31ºF).  
An inadequate blood circulation when the ambient temperature is low leads to frostbites. 
Causes can be exposure to extreme cold weather, wearing inadequate or wet clothing, or 
wind chill. The poor blood circulation caused by too tight clothing or boots, staying in a 
cramped position, fatigue, certain medications, smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect 
the blood vessels, such as diabetes may enhance the process.  
Frostbites can affect any part of your body. However, the extremities, such as the hands, feet, 
ears, nose and lips, are most likely to be affected as the body is constricting circulation to 
extremities on its own to preserve core temperature and fight hypothermia. 
The symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful. If 
exposure to the cold continues, the person may feel pins and needles before the area 
becomes numb as the tissues freeze. 
People with a history of severe frostbite often report after effects of frostbite. These can include: 
 
increased sensitivity to cold; 
 
numbness in the affected body parts, most commonly the fingers; 
 
reduced sense of touch in the affected body parts; and 
 
persistent pain in the affected body parts. 
H.6.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You may observe following signs and symptoms: 
 
The person complains of feeling pins and needles, throbbing or aching in the 
affected area.  
 
The skin feels cold, numb and white. 
 
The person may feel a tingling sensation. 
If the frostbite is more advanced:  
 
the affected area may feel hard and frozen; 
 
when the person is out of the cold: 
 
the tissue is thawed out (defrosted and becomes soft);  
 
the skin will turn red and blister, which can be painful; 
 
there may also be swelling and itching. 
If the exposure to the cold continues and the frostbite develops further: 


  
213 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
the skin becomes white, blue or blotchy, and 
 
the tissue underneath feels hard and cold to touch. 
When the person is out of the cold and the skin thaws (defrosts): 
• 
blood-filled blisters form and turn into thick black scabs. At this stage, it is likely that 
some tissue has died. This is known as tissue necrosis, and the tissue may have to be 
removed to prevent infection. 
H.6.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
H.6.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST 
1. Make sure you are protected sufficiently against the cold, prior helping the other 
person 
H.6.2.2 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
2. If possible, move the victim to a warmer place.  
3. It is best that the person avoids to walk on frostbitten toes and feet as this can cause 
further damage, although in emergency situations this may not always be possible. 
 
4. Replace wet clothing with soft, dry clothing to stop further heat loss. 
 


  
214 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
5. Gently remove gloves, rings, and other constrictions, such as boots. 
 
6. The affected areas need to be re-warmed.  
Do not try to do this until you are out of the cold. If the warming process is started 
and the frozen parts are re-exposed to the cold, it can cause further irreversible 
damage. 
 
You can warm the affected part with your hands, in your lap, or in the person’s 
armpits. 
 
7. Do not rub the affected area as this can damage the skin and other tissues and do 
more harm than benefit.  
 


  
215 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
8. Do not apply direct heat (such as from a fire or heater) as this can cause further 
injury. 
9. Re-warming should last at least 30 minutes and should only be stopped once the 
affected body part has a red-purple colour and can be easily moved. 
 
10. Do not allow the person to smoke as this can affect blood circulation. 
 
11. After the frostbitten area has been thawed, it should be wrapped very gently in 
clean bandages, with the fingers and toes separated. It is very important to keep 
the skin clean to avoid infection.  Wash your hands prior bandaging the frostbites. 
12. Too much movement should be avoided, and the limbs should be elevated if 
possible. Ask the person not to walk on affected parts that have been re-warmed 
as the tissues will be very delicate. 
13. Refer the person with frostbites to a healthcare facility. 
Transport the person to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital in case of 
advanced frostbites. 
H.6.2.3 
HYGIENE 
Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If 
no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be 
used, if available.  
H.6.3 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Always urgently transport the person suffering severe frostbites to the nearest healthcare 
facility. 
A person with minor frostbites should also always be referred to a healthcare facility.

PREVENTION OF BURNS 
Burn injuries can be caused by cooking accidents, house fires, electrical faults, candles, 
incense, or children accessing fire or heat sources.  
Burn wounds cause a lot of pain, scars, deformities and even death. Burn injuries can easily be 
prevented by simply following simple precautions: 
Teach and protect the children: 
 
Teach children about household objects that can burn them, could cause fire and 
explain the danger of fire to them.  
 
Do not leave children alone near heat sources, hot water, or open fires.  
 
Install fences around open fires to discourage children from standing too close. 
 
Hot drinks and liquids should be kept out of reach of young children. 
 
Cover the electric points properly. 
Cooking & heating: 
 
Ensure that gas cylinders do not leak. 
 
Switch off the gas supply after the work is over. 
 
Designate a specific cooking area, for example by making a raised stove with a 
mud barrier when you cook outside. 
 
The safest cooking height is when the cooking area is raised to a height that allows 
cooking whilst standing. 
 
Keep children out of cooking areas. 
 
Never leave food unattended on a stove. 
 
Turn the pot and pan handles towards the back of the stove when cooking, so that 
children can’t accidently knock them over. 
 
Do not leave spoons or utensils in pots when cooking. 
 
Only handle pots and pans with the insulated handles, or use cloth or other 
protective material before touching the handle.  
 
Avoid wearing clothing that could easily catch fire whilst cooking. Avoid wearing 
loose clothing when cooking or handling a fire. Do not hang clothes near an open 
fire. 
 
Do not keep flammable objects like towels, potholders near to the fire.  
 
Do not overheat oil when cooking. 
 
Never use water to extinguish burning oil  
 
Be careful when handling kerosene stoves and lamps as they can easily be 
knocked over and ignite.  
 
Have something handy to extinguish a fire (wet towel or cloth, water, sand bucket, 
fire extinguisher).  
 


  
217 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Electricity: 
 
Remove electrical cords from floors and keep them out of reach. 
 
Do not overload the electricity sockets. 
 
Use correct wiring. 
 
Do not use electrical appliances near water.  
 
Use plug protectors to make sure children can’t stick something in the electrical 
outlets and get electrocuted.  
Candles and lights: 
 
Do not leave burning candles unattended. 
 
Ensure they are in a sturdy metal, glass or ceramic holder. Place them where they 
cannot be knocked down, 
 
Do not burn candles near flammable materials (like curtains).  
 
Never sleep with a kerosene lamp near the bed. 
Smoking: 
 
Never smoke in bed. 
 
Do not leave cigarettes burning unattended. 
 
Do not empty smouldering ashes into a trash can. Keep ashtrays away from clothes.  
Bathing: 
 
To prepare water at the right bathing or washing temperature, use cold water first and 
mix this with hot water (do not pour the hot water first and cool it down afterwards with 
cold water).  
 
Make sure bathwater is not too hot. Test the temperature of the water before putting 
children in the bath tub. Your water geysers should be set at 49-54 °C (120-130 °F).  
Chemical and inflammable products 
 
Never store flammable products in the proximity of a heat source.  
 
Store chemical, flammable or corrosive products safely out of the reach of children.  
 
Store chemical products at the eye level of an adult person; higher placed items are 
more difficult to reach and might spill over you when reaching for them. 
 
Be careful when handling chemical products – they can create burn wounds when 
spilled on the skin, face or eyes.  
 
Use the right containers to store chemicals in and label them.  
 
Do not reuse old bottles of drinks for storage of chemicals.  
Heat: 
 
Do not stay too long in direct sunlight.  
 
Drink water and liquids frequently, especially in hot weather.

FEVER 
A fever is a temporary increase in the body temperature. Fever can be a sign of serious illness. 
Any person with fever needs medical attention to determine the cause. Fever caused by 
malaria, typhoid, pneumonia (lung infection) etc., can be very dangerous if they are left 
untreated and can lead to death.  
The normal body temperature is around 37 °C (98.6 °F).  Fever is generally agreed to be present 
if the temperature is above 37.7 °C (100 °F). 
Following set points are used to identify fever: 
 
If the temperature in the anus (anal/rectal) is at or over 38.0 °C (100.4 °F). 
 
If the temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over 37.7 °C (100 °F). 
 
If the temperature under the arm (axillary) or in the ear (otic) is at or over 37.2 °C (99.0 
°F). 
H.8.1 
HOW TO MEASURE THE BODY TEMPERATURE? 
The body’s temperature can be measured by a thermometer you place in the armpit, 
mouth, rectum, ear or on the forehead.   
H.8.1.1 
TYPES OF THERMOMETERS 
H.8.1.1.1 
 MERCURY TEMPERATURE THERMOMETERS 
 
In a mercury thermometer, a glass tube is filled with mercury and a standard temperature 
scale is marked on the tube. A mercury thermometer can be easily identified by the 
presence of a silver bulb. Do not use mercury thermometers to measure the body 
temperature via the mouth or rectum. 
If the bulb is red, blue, purple, green or any other colour, it is not a mercury thermometer, 
but contains another non-poisonous fluid. It works on the same principle as a mercury 
thermometer. These type of glass thermometers also can be used to measure the body 
temperature via the mouth or rectum. 
Shake down the fluid in the glass thermometer before starting a new temperature 
measurement. Do this by holding the thermometer firmly and flicking the wrist until the fluid 
reads at or below the lowest number.  
With changes in temperature, the fluid expands and contracts in a consistent fashion and 
the temperature can be read from the scale. 


  
220 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
H.8.1.1.2 
ELECTRONIC BODY TEMPERATURE THERMOMETERS 
 
Electronic thermometers exist in different formats and types. These mostly work on battery 
power, some use sunlight as power source. They have a display where you can read the 
measurement (in Celsius or Fahrenheit corresponding to the device settings). Most 
electronic thermometers will beep when the measurement is complete and the body 
temperature can be read of the display. 
Special electronic thermometers exist to measure the temperature via the ear or via 
scanning the forehead. 
H.8.1.2 
MEASURING THE BODY TEMPERATURE 
H.8.1.2.1 
MEASURING THE BODY TEMPERATURE IN THE ARMPIT 
1. Clean the thermometer using water and soap or rubbing alcohol.  
2. Place the thermometer in the armpit. 
 
3. Wait for five minutes or until the electronic thermometer beeps. 
4. Read the temperature.  
5. Clean the thermometer using water and soap or rubbing alcohol. 
6. Wash your hands after taking care of the person. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
H.8.1.2.2 
MEASURING THE BODY TEMPERATURE IN THE MOUTH 
1. Clean the thermometer using water and soap or rubbing alcohol. 
2. Place the thermometer in the mouth, under the tongue. 


  
221 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
` 
3. Ask the person to close the mouth and fix the thermometer via the lips, but not to 
bite on the thermometer. The person can breathe through the nose. 
4. Wait for three minutes or until the electronic thermometer beeps. 
5. Read the temperature. 
6. Clean the thermometer using water and soap or rubbing alcohol. 
7. Wash your hands after taking care of the person. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
H.8.1.2.3 
MEASURING THE BODY TEMPERATURE IN THE RECTUM 
1. This method is used for small children.  
2. Clean the thermometer using water and soap or rubbing alcohol. 
3. Put petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on the bulb of the thermometer. 
4. Place the child face down on a flat surface or knees. 
5. Spread the buttocks and insert the bulb end about 1 to 2 cm (1/2 to 1 inch) into the 
anal canal. Be careful not to insert it too far. Struggling can push the thermometer 
in further.  
 
6. Wait for three minutes or until the electronic thermometer beeps. 
7. Read the temperature. 
8. Clean the thermometer using water and soap or rubbing alcohol. 
9. Wash your hands after taking care of the person. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
 


  
222 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
H.8.1.3 
READ THE RESULT 
Read the temperature of the glass fluid or electronic thermometer immediately after taking the 
temperature.  
 
The temperature is read to the closet line of the fluid in glass fluid thermometers, or from the 
electronic display in electronic thermometers. 
A person has fever if his temperature is higher than 37.7 ° (>100 °F) in the mouth. 
If you have no thermometer you can feel with the back of the hand on the abdomen  
If the skin feels hot, the person has probably fever. 
H.8.2 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE WHEN A PERSON HAS FEVER? 
Following signs and symptoms may be observed: 
 
The person has a raised temperature. 
 
The person complains of feeling cold, but his skin feels hot. 
 
He may shiver and have chattering teeth. 
 
Later the person may show a hot, flushed skin and is sweating. 
 
The person may complain of headache, malaise (feeling sick) and muscle pain. 
 
 
 
Children under five year of age may show convulsions (aka fits) and shake fast and 
uncontrollably when their body temperature rises quickly. Seizures can occur even if 
the child has a mild fever. Alternatively, they can occur when a child’s temperature 
drops fast from a high level.  
During simple febrile seizures:  
 
the child’s body will become stiff and their arms and legs will begin to twitch,  
 
they'll lose consciousness and they may wet or soil themselves, 
 
they may also vomit and foam at the mouth and their eyes may roll back, 


  
223 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
the seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes,  
 
following the seizure, the child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwards. 
Look also for signs of dehydration, especially when the sick person has diarrhoea or vomiting, 
the sickness lasts over a longer period, or it is a sick child or elderly person.  
H.8.3 
 WHAT DO I DO? 
H.8.3.1 
HYGIENE 
1. Wash your hands before and after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water 
to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands.  
Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
H.8.3.2 
SUPPORT THE SICK PERSON 
 
2. Find out how high the temperature of the person is (see “How to measure the body 
temperature?”. 
3. Ask the person to rest. 
4. Keep the person in a cool environment. 
 
5. Give the person lots of water to drink to prevent dehydration. Check if the urine 
darkens or there is less urine. 
Breast-fed babies should be breast-fed more frequently than usual. 
Bottle-fed babies should be bottle-fed normally and should be given extra rehydration 
drinks as a supplement. 
6. Contact the local healthcare worker as soon as possible so the cause of the fever can 
be investigated.  
7. Evaluate how the person is dressed.  


  
224 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Too much clothing can increase the fever; too little can cause shivering which will 
deplete the energy of the sick person. 
 
8. Use water at room temperature to sponge the sick person unless he does not like it and 
starts shivering. Do not use cold water. 
If the person with fever is suffering he may benefit from paracetamol. Give the person 
the appropriate dose of anti-fever medication.  These medications might bring 
temporary relief, but do not treat the cause of the illness. 
9. If the sick person has convulsions (aka fits) (the person suddenly shakes fast and 
uncontrollably): treat for fits (see chapter ‘Fits – convulsions – seizures’).  
10. Keep checking on the sick person. There may be need to get up in night to check 
the temperature.  
11. If medication has been prescribed to treat the person, advice the person to finish the 
whole course of medicine. If he does not finish the whole course, the disease might 
come back. 
Advice the person to make sure the correct dose and amount of medicine is taken 
at the prescribed time intervals. Advice the parents when giving medication to a 
child to make sure that the child is not crying. When a child is crying, the medication will 
not be swallowed. 
If the sick person vomits less than 30 minutes after taking the medicine, the medicine 
can be given again. 
12. Advice not to  use, buy or give medication that has: 
 
passed the expiry date, or 
 
has been exposed to direct sunlight, or 
 
has been wet. 
13. Bring the person to a nearby healthcare facility if the fever remains or the patient’s 
condition worsens.

H.8.3.3 
HYGIENE 
Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If 
no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be 
used, if available. 
H.8.4 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Fever can be a sign of a serious illness. Any person with fever needs medical attention to 
determine the cause. It is always advised to undergo a blood test for malaria in malaria 
prone regions.  
Medical attention is especially important for babies, children, pregnant women and the 
elderly. 
Arrange transport for the person to a nearby healthcare facility if: 


HYPOTHERMIA 
 Hypothermia occurs when a person's body temperature drops below 35 °C (95 °F) (the normal 
body temperature is around 37 °C (98.6 °F)). 
Hypothermia can quickly become life threatening and should be treated as a medical 
emergency. 
It's usually caused by being in a cold environment and can be triggered by a combination of 
factors, such as being outdoors in cold conditions for a long time, living in a poorly 
heated house or falling into cold water. 
H.9.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You may observe following signs and symptoms: 
 
shivering, though this may stop as body temperature drops; 
 
slurred speech or mumbling; 
 
slow, shallow breathing; 
 
weak pulse; 
 
clumsiness or lack of coordination; 
 
drowsiness or very low energy; 
 
confusion or memory loss; 
 
loss of consciousness; or 
 
bright red, cold skin (in infants). 
H.9.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
H.9.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST 
1. Make sure you are protected sufficiently against the cold, prior helping the other 
person 
H.9.2.2 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
2. Gently move the person out of the cold.  
If going indoors isn't possible, protect the person from the wind, especially around 
the neck and head and insulate the individual from the cold ground. 
 


  
227 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
3. Gently remove wet clothing. Replace wet things with warm, dry coats or blankets. 
4. If further warming is needed, do so gradually. For example, apply warm, dry 
compresses to the center of the body — neck, chest and groin.  
 
5. Offer the person warm, sweet, non-alcoholic drinks slowly in sips. This is another 
important exception to general principles of first aid (not giving casualty to eat or 
drink). 
 
6. Do not apply direct heat. Do not rewarm the person too quickly, such as with a 
heating lamp or hot bath. 
 
 
7. Don't attempt to warm the arms and legs. Heating or massaging the limbs of 
someone in this condition can stress the heart and lungs. 


  
228 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Do not eat, drink, or smoke. 
8. Don't give the person alcohol or cigarettes. Alcohol hinders the rewarming process, 
and tobacco products interfere with circulation that is needed for rewarming. 
9. Urgently transport the person to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital. 
H.9.2.2.1 
WHAT DO I DO IF THE PERSON IS UNCONSCIOUS, BUT IS STILL BREATHING?

TITLE OF CHAPTER
I.1 
POISONING  
Some substances when taken in can be dangerous to the health of human beings and can 
even cause death. Such substances are called ‘poisons’ or ‘toxins’. 
Poisoning can occur when these poisons are taken by accident or with a view to causing 
harm or committing suicide. 
Poisons can get into the body by swallowing, inhaling (gases), by injection or via 
absorption through the skin. 
I.1.1 
POISONING BY SWALLOWING 
Poisoning from swallowing is often caused by household products, overdose of 
medication or toxic plants.  
The effects of poisoning depend on what poison has been swallowed. 
 
Acids, alkalis, disinfectants etc. swallowed burn the lips, tongue, throat, oesophagus 
and stomach and cause great pain.  
 
Other swallowed poisons cause vomiting, pain abdomen and later on diarrhoea 
(e.g. poisonous fungi, berries, metallic poisons).  
 
Some swallowed poisons affect the nervous system. To this group belong: 
 
alcoholic drinks (methylated spirit, wine, whisky etc.) when taken in large 
quantities; 
 
sleeping pills, tranquilizers, and painkillers  when taken in overdoses. 
Victims of poisoning must be considered as seriously ill. The symptoms are either delirium or fits 
or coma. 
Please note that ‘Food poisoning’ is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. Please 
see the ‘Food poisoning’ chapter for more information on this topic. 
I.1.2 
POISONING BY GASES 
Fumes or gases from charcoal stoves, household gas, motor exhausts and smoke from 
explosions etc., cause # CHOKING choking (asphyxia) which may result in # UNCONSCIOUS unconsciousness in addition to 
difficulty in breathing.  Please refer to the chapter on ‘Suffocation by smoke or gasses’ for more 
information. 
I.1.3 
POISONING BY INJECTION 
Poisons get into the body through injection, bites of poisonous snakes and rabid dogs, or stings 
by scorpions and poisonous insects. Danger to life is again by # CHOKING choking and coma. Please refer 
to the chapter on animal bites for more information. 
I.1.4 
POISONING BY SKIN ABSORPTION 
Hazardous chemicals that are spilt on the skin can cause irritation or # BURNS burns. Certain substances 
can be also absorbed through the skin and cause damage inside the body. Please refer to the 
chapter on ‘Chemical # BURNS burns’ for more information.

WHAT DO I DO? 
I.1.6.1 
SAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP 
1. Secure your own safety, and then the safety of the affected person. 
2. The person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave 
the person unattended. Ask a bystander to call the anti-poison centre (toll free: 1800 
116 117) and to seek help or to arrange for urgent transport to the nearest healthcare 
facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured. 
3. If possible, wash your hands before and after taking care of the patient. Use soap and 
water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your 
hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
J.1 
ANIMAL BITES (DOG, CAT, MONKEY, MONGOOSE, HORSE, COW OR OTHER 
ANIMAL BITES) 
Any bite of an animal (or human) that breaks the skin needs special attention because it carries 
a high risk of infection! 
Many animals including dog, cat, monkey, fox, bat, cow, horse or jackals may carry germ of 
rabies.  Rabies is a viral infection that targets the brain and nervous system. A person can catch 
rabies when bitten or scratched by an infected animal. If not treated urgently, the disease is 
lethal. All victims of dog (cat, monkey, jackals etc.) bites or scratches need to be referred 
immediately for further treatment and follow up.  
J.1.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
You might see the following on a person that has been bitten: 
 
Bite marks. 
 
Puncture wounds (if skin is broken). 
 
Scraped skin. 
 
Moderate or severe # BLEEDING bleeding. 
 
Local swelling. 
 
Redness. 
 
Pain.

PROVIDE FIRST AID 
 
4. Flush the wound immediately with lots of clean water and then wash the wound 
with soap and water or a detergent for 10-15 minutes, if available to remove the 
rabies virus from the wound. Wash with povidone-iodine (Alopim, Betadine, Clopo, 
Wokadine, a.o.)  if available. Washing is also necessary when a person is licked, 
scratched or has abrasion.  
5. 
If the person is severely # BLEEDING bleeding, stop the # BLEEDING bleeding by applying pressure to the 
wound. 
6. Do not cut the wound larger. 
7. Do not put herbs or unclean materials like chilies, oil, petrol in or on the wound. 
 
 
8. Cover the wound with a dry clean cloth or bandage. 
9. Refer the person to a healthcare facility immediately for further treatment.

SNAKE BITES 
There are more than 2500 different kinds of snakes. The effects of # SNAKE_BITE snake bites vary according 
to the type of snake. Note that not all snakes are poisonous, not all poisonous ones are lethal, 
but one should always be careful handling snakes. All # SNAKE_BITE snake bites should be treated as if they 
are poisonous bites. Snakes rarely strike when not disturbed or threatened. 
J.2.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
If a person has been bitten by a snake, you might observe: 
 
# BLEEDING bleeding, 
 
swelling, 
 
bruising, 
 
pain, 
 
numbness, 
 
weakness, 
 
confusion, 
 
affected vision, 
 
affected speech, 
 
nausea or vomiting, 


J.2.2 
WHAT DO I DO?  
J.2.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST 
1. Make sure the area is safe before you assist the person. 
2. The injured person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but 
do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange 
urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to 
confirm if help has been secured.

PROVIDE FIRST AID 
3. Comfort person 


  
239 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
4. Help the injured person to lie down and tell him not to move. Offer comfort and 
keep the person calm, but do not forcibly restrain him.  Keeping calm and not 
moving will slow the spread of the venom. 
If safe to do so, check what type of snake has bitten the person. If possible, note 
down the features of the snake. Do not lose time chasing the snake: the person 
needs urgent help now. It is difficult to assess whether a snake is poisonous or not. 
Therefore, always assume that the snake is poisonous. 
5. Watch the person for any change in his condition (i.e. consciousness and 
breathing). 
 
6. Put on gloves if they are available. If not available, you can also use a clean plastic 
bag to cover your hands.  
Try not to come in contact with the person's blood. 
 
7. Do not suck or cut the venom out of the skin. 
Do not rub herbs on the bite. 
 
8. Do not apply a tourniquet. 


  
240 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
9. Remove any rings, watches or tight clothing that may cut off the blood flow 
because of swelling.  
10. Try not to move the injured limb and eventually apply a splint to immobilize the 
affected part. 
 
11. Cover the wound with a clean cotton cloth or bandage. 
12. Once action to obtain help has been taken, stay with the injured person until help 
is available. 
13. Observe the condition of the person (i.e. consciousness and breathing). 
14. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital. 
J.2.2.2.1

J.3 
INSECT STINGS AND BITES 
Most insect bites and stings cause small reactions that are confined to the area of the bite or 
sting (local reaction). They can usually be treated at home.  
Insect stings inside the throat are dangerous due to potential swelling and can be life- 
threatening.  
Mites, ticks and leeches are found in marshes and jungles. They attach themselves firmly to the 
skin. Mites and ticks might carry typhus and may transmit it to the person. Ticks may also transmit 
the lyme disease.  
Leeches are mostly harmless, but suck blood from the victim.  
The effects of stings from scorpions or bites of spiders vary according to the type of the insect. 
Note that not all insects are poisonous. 
J.3.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
If a person has been stung or bitten by an insect, you might observe: 
 
pain, 
 
swelling, 
 
redness or rash, 
 
itching, 
 
some animals stay sucked onto the skin. 
Some people experience an allergic reaction to the sting. This reaction can be localised or 
systemic. A systemic allergic reaction requires immediate medical attention as it is potentially 
life-threatening. 
A person with a systemic allergic reaction may show the following symptoms: 
 
rash; 
 
itching; 
 
wheezing, hoarseness of voice or difficulty in breathing; 
 
dizziness or feeling faint; 
 
difficulty in swallowing; 
 
a swollen face or lips; 
 
nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea; 
 
confusion, anxiety or agitation. 
The effects of bites or stings from scorpions or spiders vary according to the type of the animal. 
Note that not all insects are poisonous.

WHAT DO I DO? 
J.3.2.1 
SAFETY FIRST 
1. Make sure the area is safe before you assist the person.  
2. If you are in an area where the wasp or hornet is still around, walk calmly away to 
a safer area with the victim. If attacked by a swarm, run away as fast as possible 
and seek shelter (indoors, in a car…). 
J.3.2.2 
PROVIDE FIRST AID 
3. Ask the person to keep calm. 
J.3.2.2.1 
IN CASE OF A BEE OR WASP STING 
Removing the sting of bees (wasps and hornets don’t usually leave their sting behind) 
as quickly as possible can help to keep the bite smaller. Use a finger nail, the edge of 
a bankcard, or whatever thin sturdy material you have at hand to remove the sting. 
This can be easily done by pushing upwards from underneath the sting site in a sliding 
position. 
J.3.2.2.2 
IN CASE OF A TICK BITE 
 
Remove ticks using fine tweezers (not with fingers) and grab the tick as close to the 
skin as possible. Pull it firmly up until the tick’s mouthparts have been removed.   
Do not twist or jerk the tick to remove it.  
Do not use petroleum jelly, alcohol, a lit match or cigarette, or any other method to 
try to remove a tick. 


  
245 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
J.3.2.2.3 
IN CASE OF A LEECH BITE 
 
If you find one leech on the person’s body, check the entire body as there may be 
more.  Slide a fingernail, the edge of a bankcard or whatever thin sturdy material you 
have at hand, under the sucker mouth (the smaller head of the leech) of the leech 
and flick it off right away. Do not squeeze the leech.  
The person may also consider the leech to fill up and fall off by themselves. 
Do not put salt on the leech or burn it, as this will make the leech to vomit back into 
the wound before it falls of. Leech bites tend to bleed for a long time, apply a small 
bandage and change it regularly. 
 
4. Wash the sting or bite site and wipe away any venom. 
5. Do not suck or cut the venom out of the skin. 
Do not rub herbs on the bite. 
 
6.  Use ice, if you have it, to cool the bite or sting. 
Wrap the ice in a cloth or a towel so that it does not touch the skin directly. 
If you do not have ice, use cold water.  
Do not cool for more than 20 minutes at a time.

K. 
SENSES, FOREIGN BODIES IN EYE, EAR, NOSE OR SKIN AND     
SWALLOWED FOREIGN OBJECTS 
In this chapter you will learn about: 
 Senses. 
 Foreign objects in the eye, ear, nose or skin. 
 Swallowed foreign objects. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


  
248 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
K.1 
THE SENSES 
The human body exchanges information with its environment via five senses: 
 
Sight (the eyes). 
 
Hearing (the ears). 
 
Smelling (the nose). 
 
Tasting (the tongue and nose). 
 
Touching (the skin). 
In addition to these five senses, the human body senses heat and cold (thermoception), 
balance and acceleration (vestibular sense), the relative position on  its body parts 
(kinaesthetic sense or proprioception), feels pain (nociception) and can perceive time 
(chronoception). 
K.1.1 
EYE 
 
The eyeballs are covered with folds of skin (the eyelids) from which the eyelashes project.  The 
outermost parts of eyes are covered by a smooth membrane (conjunctiva) and are kept moist 
by tears produced by the tear-glands. 
 
The transparent portion of the eye is called cornea through which the light from the object 
passes and forms the image at the back of the eye. Behind the cornea is seen a coloured 


  
249 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
circular diaphragm (iris) with a round opening (hole), the pupil. The latter varies in size with the 
amount of light passing through it. 
Behind the pupil is the lens of the eye which focuses rays of light on to the light sensitive part of 
the eye (retina). 
Both eyes move simultaneously. 
K.1.2 
EAR 
 
The ear consists of three parts: 
1. The outer ear is that part which can be seen projecting from the side of the skull, 
together with the canal which leads to the eardrum. 
2. The middle ear, situated inside the skull, receives and transmits sound waves 
concerned in hearing to the inner ear. It also communicates with the back of the 
nose and throat through the Eustachian tube, which opens during swallowing.  
3. The inner ear is embedded inside the skull and is concerned with the sense of 
balance in addition to the sense of hearing. The outer ear is separated from the 
middle ear by the eardrum. 
 
 


  
250 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
K.1.3 
TONGUE  
 
The tongue is the muscular organ which lies on the floor of the mouth; it assists in tasting, 
mastication and swallowing of food. 
In an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious casualty, the tongue tends to obstruct by falling back in the throat and 
prevents breathing. 
K.1.4 
NOSE 
 
The nose is organ of smell and also functions as part of the body's respiratory system. Air enters 
into the body through the nose. As it passes over the specialized cells of the olfactory system, 
the brain recognizes and identifies smells. Hairs in the nose clean the air of foreign particles. As 
air moves through the nasal passages, it is warmed and humidified before it goes into the lungs.  
People may not taste anything without some help from the nose: the ability to smell and taste 
go together because odours from foods allow to taste more fully. 
K.1.5 
SKIN  
The pain and touch receptors in the skin allow us to feel touch, pressure, heat, cold and pain. 
See also the chapter on ‘The skin’ for more detail.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
K.2 
FOREIGN OBJECTS IN THE EYE, EAR, NOSE OR SKIN 
K.2.1 
FOREIGN BODY IN THE EYE 
Wings of insects, dust, coal, metal particles from lathes and loose eye-lashes are common 
objects which get lodged under the eyelids. They cause pain and later redness if they are not 
removed at-once.  
Sometimes iron particles and wood splinters get lodged in the cornea causing severe trouble.  
All penetrating foreign bodies are a danger to the eye itself. 
K.2.1.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
Following signs or symptoms may be observed: 
 
The person complains of pain or discomfort in the eye. 
 
Redness and watery eyes. 
 
The person complains of a blurred vision. 
 
Eyelids are screwed up in spasm. 
K.2.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
1. Ask the casualty not to rub into the eye. 
2. Ask the casualty to sit. Pull the lower lid down to inspect.  
 
3. Rinse the eye immediately with plenty of water for 10-15 minutes, preferably from the 
nose outwards. Use clean water or water that has been boiled and cooled. 
Be careful: 
 
Water at room temperature is more comfortable than cold water. 
 
Very warm water might burn the eye.  
Make sure no liquid or rinsing water runs into the other eye. 


  
252 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
4. If washing of eyes did not work, you may try to remove foreign object with a narrow 
moist swab or a twisted corner of a clean handkerchief. 
If foreign body is not visible it may be under the upper eye lid. Ask the casualty to 
grasp his upper lashes and pull the upper eyelid over the lower lid. The lower lashes 
may brush the particle clear. 
If this did not work, you may ask the casualty to blink under clean water. You can 
also use an eye cup to blink the eye in it. 
5. If something is sticking to or embedded in the eye, the eyeball or pupil, do not try 
to remove it.  
6. Cover the eye and transport the casualty to the nearest healthcare facility for 
further care. 
7. Do not put medication into the eye. 
8. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
K.2.2.1.1 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THERE ARE BURNS TO THE EYE? 
Provide first aid as described in the section on # BURNS burns to the eye. 
K.2.2.1.2 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THERE ARE HARMFUL LIQUIDS SPILLED INTO THE EYE? 
Provide first aid as described in the section on chemical # BURNS burns to the eye.  
K.2.3 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Eye injuries have to be managed always with great care. Always refer these victims to 
the nearest healthcare facility.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
K.3 
FOREIGN BODY IN THE EAR 
Sometimes foreign objects become lodged in the ear. The object might even damage the 
drum.  
Children often push objects into their ears. Cotton wool may get stuck in the ear while cleaning 
it. Insects may crawl or fly into the ear. 
K.3.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
Following signs or symptoms may be observed: 
 
The person complains of pain or itching in the ear. 
 
The person complains of worsened hearing. 
 
There may be damage to the drum if: 
o 
the person hears a constant noise; 
o 
the person complains of ear pain; 
o 
blood comes out of the ear, or 
o 
the person feels dizzy. 
K.3.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
 
Never try to get lodged objects out of the ear and always refer the person to a 
healthcare facility for further treatment. 
In case of an insect, you may fill the ear with tepid clean water so the insect can float 
out. If it does not come out refer the person to a healthcare facility for further 
treatment. 
K.3.3 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
A casualty with an object lodged into the ear has always to be referred to a healthcare 
facility.  
Also refer the casualty to a healthcare facility in case of an insect that flew or crawled into 
the ear and did not come out.

K.5 
FOREIGN BODY IN THE SKIN 
Glass, thorns, pieces of iron, wood or stone, needles, etc. may get stuck under the skin. 
Unless it is very easy to deal with (e.g. a wood splinter), do not fiddle with objects stuck under 
the skin.  
Treat the wound as described in section ‘Bleeding’, dress the wound and refer the casualty to 
a healthcare facility for further treatment.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
K.6 
SWALLOWED FOREIGN OBJECTS 
Small objects as coins and buttons may be swallowed by children.  Most objects will follow the 
digestive track without issues. But they can also lead to # CHOKING choking. 
In some cases the swallowed object may cause internal damage. This is specifically the case 
for swallowed batteries (containing corrosive and poisonous material), cigarette stubs, 
cosmetics, medication, poisonous plants, poisonous berries or fruits, or sharp objects (e.g. fish 
bones, partial dentures…). In these cases medical assistance is always required. 
K.6.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
Except if the person is # CHOKING choking, you may not observe any signs or symptoms at first and it is the 
person himself who reports you that he swallowed something. 
Sometimes the swallowed object may cause # CHOKING choking; this can result in a life threatening 
situation and has to be taken care of immediately (see section on ‘Choking’ for more detail). 
In some cases the casualty may complain of pain in the throat, food pipe (oesophagus) or 
stomach. Also vomiting is possible. At a later stage blood may appear in the faeces. 
K.6.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
In case the person is # CHOKING choking, treat as described in the section on ‘Choking’. 
In case a small harmless object has been swallowed, the object will follow the normal track 
and be expelled via the faeces. In case of even small doubt, contact a healthcare facility. 
In case of dangerous objects (batteries, cigarette stubs, cosmetics, medication, poisonous 
plants, poisonous berries or fruits …), sharp objects or when the person complains of pain, 
stomach ache, always refer the casualty to the nearest healthcare facility. 
K.6.3 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?  
In case a person swallowed dangerous objects (as batteries, cigarette stubs, cosmetics, 
medication, poisonous plants, poisonous berries or fruits …), sharp objects; or when the 
person complains of pain, stomach ache or blood loss in the faeces, he should be 
transported to the nearest healthcare facility.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
L.1 
URINARY SYSTEM 
The body takes nutrients from food and converts them to energy. After the body has taken the 
food components that it needs, waste products are left behind in the bowel and in the blood. 
The kidney and urinary systems help the body to eliminate liquid waste called urea, and to 
keep chemicals, such as potassium and sodium, and water in balance. Urea is produced when 
foods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables, are broken down in 
the body. Urea is carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is removed along with 
water and other wastes in the form of urine. 
Other important functions of the kidneys include blood pressure regulation and the production 
of erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell production in the bone marrow. Kidneys also 
regulate the acid-base balance and conserve fluids. 
 
A pair of purplish-brown organs, the kidneys, are located below the ribs toward the middle of 
the back. The functions of the kidneys are to: 
 
Remove waste products and drugs from the body. 
 
Balance the body's fluids. 
 
Release hormones to regulate blood pressure. 
 
Control production of red blood cells. 
The kidneys remove urea from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons. Each 
nephron consists of a ball formed of small blood capillaries, called a glomerulus, and a small 
tube called a renal tubule. Urea, together with water and other waste substances, forms the 
urine as it passes through the nephrons and down the renal tubules of the kidney 


  
259 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Two narrow tubes (one on each side), called ureters, carry urine from the kidneys to the 
bladder. Muscles in the ureter walls continually tighten and relax forcing urine downward, away 
from the kidneys. If urine backs up, or is allowed to stand still, an infection can develop. About 
every 10 to 15 seconds, small amounts of urine are emptied into the bladder from the ureters. 
The bladder, a triangle-shaped, hollow organ, is located in the lower abdomen. It is held in 
place by ligaments that are attached to other organs and the pelvic bones. The bladder's walls 
relax and expand to store urine, and contract and flatten to empty urine through the urethra. 
The typical healthy adult bladder can store up about 500-600 ml (ca. two cups) of urine for two 
to five hours. 
Two sphincter muscles (circular muscles) help keep urine from leaking by closing tightly like a 
rubber band around the opening of the bladder. Nerves in the bladder alert a person when it 
is time to urinate, or empty the bladder.  
The urethra allows urine to pass outside the body. The brain signals the bladder muscles to 
tighten, which squeezes urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the 
sphincter muscles to relax to let urine exit the bladder through the urethra. When all the signals 
occur in the correct order, normal urination occurs. 
Urine in a healthy person is of a pale straw or transparent yellow colour.

REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
L.2.1 
 MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
 
The external reproductive organ of the male is the penis. The penis is made up of two parts, the 
shaft and the glans. The glans is the tip of the penis, while the shaft is the main part of the penis 
and contains the tube (urethra) that drains the bladder. All boys are born with a foreskin, or a 
covering over the tip of the penis. Some boys are circumcised, which means that this covering 
of skin is removed. Other boys are not circumcised and may have skin that covers the tip of 
the penis. 
The scrotum is a bag of skin which holds and helps to protect the testicles. The testicles (or 
testes) are the male sex glands and are part of the male reproductive system. They are located 
in the scrotum. To make sperm the temperature of the testicles needs to be cooler than the 
inside of the body. This is why they are located in the scrotum outside body. The testes are also 
involved in producing a hormone called testosterone. Testosterone is an important hormone 
during male development and maturation for developing muscles, deepening the voice, and 
growing body hair.  
A long tube, the epididymis, is located near each testicle. The epididymis is a collection of 
microscopic tubes in which the sperms are stored. The vas deferens is the tube which moves 
the sperms from the testicles out of the scrotal sac to the urethra and connects these together. 
Seminal vesicles, the sac-like glands, lie behind the bladder and release a fluid that forms part 
of semen. 
The prostate gland is about the size of a walnut, and surrounds the neck of the bladder and 
urethra. The prostate gland secretes a slightly alkaline fluid that forms part of the seminal fluid, 
a fluid that carries sperms. During male climax (orgasm), the muscular glands of the prostate 
help to propel the prostate fluid, in addition to sperms that were made in the testicles, into the 
urethra. 
The urethra is the tube that allows urine to flow outside the body. It is also the channel for semen 
to pass during ejaculation.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
L.2.2 
FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
 
Although a woman’s external genitals are commonly referred to as the “vagina,” the vagina 
is actually one of several organs that comprise this section of a woman’s body.  
The vagina is a muscular tube about three to four inches long that ends the birth canal. This is 
where a man’s penis enters the woman during sexual intercourse. The vaginal opening is visible 
from the outside but it is protected by the labia  
The labia majora are two folds of skin that extend from the front of the vaginal opening to the 
back of it. The outer surfaces of the folds have darker-colored skin and thick hairs, while the 
inner folds are smoother.  The labia majora join to form the cleft shape of the female genitals.  
The clitoris is a crucial element for sexual arousal in most women. This small sexual organ at the 
junction of the labia minora appears outside the folds of skin like a small pink button. During 
sexual stimulation, the clitoris functions much like a man’s penis in that it becomes erect due to 
the signals from the brain. The clitoris is a very sensitive area when stimulated.  
Between the labia majora are the labia minora, two folds of skin that also extend down from 
the clitoris and around the vaginal opening. These vary in size from woman to woman. They 
are joined together by a small fold of skin known as the fourchette. 
The outer female genitals also include the urethra. Located between the vaginal opening and 
the frontal connection of the labia minora, the urethral opening is where a woman expels urine 
from her body. 
The womb or uterus is located between the bladder and the rectum, in the pelvic area. The 
uterus is connected to the fallopian tubes, the cervix, and (via the cervix) the vagina.   
In menstruating females, the ovaries release eggs that travel via the fallopian tubes to the 
uterus. If fertilized, the egg will bind to the wall of the uterus and the foetus will develop. The 
uterus nourishes and protects the foetus until birth. 
The cervix of the uterus, also known as the cervix or uterine cervix, attaches the vagina to the 
uterus. It is approximately four centimetres long. The uterine cervix produces a mucus that aids 
in carrying sperm from the vagina to the uterus, where it can fertilize an egg if the woman is 
ovulating. When the woman isn't ovulating, the cervical mucus thickens and serves as a barrier 
to keep sperm out of the uterus. 
During childbirth, the cervix thins out and eventually dilates (expands) to 10 centimetres to 
allow the baby to pass through the birth canal. Once the baby is born and the placenta is 
expelled, the cervix begins to thicken and close. 


  
262 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
The ovary is the ductless female reproductive gland in which the female reproductive cells are 
produced. Females have a pair of ovaries, held by a ligament beside the uterus on each side 
of the lower abdomen.   
During ovulation, a follicle (a small egg in the ovary) expels an egg under the stimulation of 
gonadotropic hormones. The rest of the follicle, or the corpus luteum, secretes the sex 
hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and control the 
development of the sex organs. The sex hormones and the gonadotropic hormones interact 
with each other to control the menstrual cycle. 
When an egg matures, it is released and passes into the fallopian tube toward the uterus. If the 
ovum is fertilized by the male reproductive cell, or sperm, conception happens and pregnancy 
begins.

L.3 
PREGNANCY 
The signs of pregnancy vary from woman to woman. Usually the most obvious sign is the 
absence of menstruation (amenorrhea). However, some women may continue to have some 
# BLEEDING bleeding even while pregnant. The following are the most common initial signs of pregnancy. 
However, each woman may experience the signs of pregnancy differently. These may include: 
 
fatigue, 
 
sore and swollen breasts, 
 
nausea or vomiting (also called morning sickness), 
 
frequent urination, 
 
certain food cravings or aversions, 
 
bloating of the abdomen, and 
 
darkening of the skin around the breast nipples (also called the areola). 
These early signs may not always indicate pregnancy, but may signal another process 
occurring within the body 
A pregnancy is divided into three phases, called trimesters. Each trimester has its own significant 
milestones. The first trimester is the most fragile period, during which all major organs and 
systems are formed. Most birth defects and miscarriages occur during the first trimester. During 
the second and third trimesters, the foetus is fully formed and grows and matures rapidly. 
After nine months of incredible growth and changes both in the mother and the foetus, labour 
(contractions) may finally start, signalling the pending birth of the baby. Some women may 
fear the prospect of delivering their child. Part of this fear may be attributed to the unknown, 
especially in first pregnancy. 
Labour is a series of continuous, progressive contractions of the uterus which help the cervix to 
open (dilate) and to thin (efface), allowing the foetus to move through the birth canal.  Signs 
of labour vary from woman to woman, as each woman experiences labour differently.  
Some common signs of labour may include: 
 
A small amount of mucus, slightly mixed with blood, may be expelled from the 
vagina indicating a woman is in labour.  
 
 
Contractions (uterine muscle spasms) occurring at intervals of less than ten minutes 
are usually an indication that labour has begun. Contractions may become more 
frequent and severe as labour progresses.  
 
 
Labour sometimes begins with amniotic fluid gushing or leaking from the vagina. 
Women who experience a rupture of the amniotic sac should go to the healthcare 
facility immediately. The majority of women go into labour within hours after the 
amniotic sac breaks. If labour still does not begin, it needs to be induced.  
 
 
 


  
264 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
L.3.1 
STAGES OF LABOUR AND GIVING BIRTH 
There are three stages of labour: 
1. The first stage, when the contractions make the cervix gradually open up (dilate). 
This is usually the longest stage. 
2. The second stage of labour is when the cervix is fully open and birth is given. This is 
the part of labour where the baby moves through the vagina by the woman in 
labour pushing with the contractions. 
3. The third stage of labour is after the birth, when the womb contracts and causes 
the placenta to come out through the vagina. 
L.3.1.1 
THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR – DILATION 
The cervix needs to open about ten cm for a baby to pass through. This is what's called being 
"fully dilated". Contractions at the start of labour help to soften the cervix so that it gradually 
opens. 
The woman in labour should attempt to get comfortable and relaxed, and if possible try to 
sleep. A warm bath or shower may help to relax.  
During the day, the woman in labour can keep upright and be gently active. This helps the 
baby move down into the pelvis and helps the cervix to dilate. 
Once labour is established, the cervix reaches an opening of more than three centimetres; the 
time to full dilation is usually between 6 and 12 hours. It is often quicker in subsequent 
pregnancies. The woman in labour will be asked not to try to push until the cervix is fully open 
and the baby’s head can be seen. To help to overcome the urge to push, breathing out slowly 
and gently or, if the urge is too strong breathing in small puffs may help. Some women find this 
easier lying on their side, or on their knees and elbows, to reduce the pressure of the baby’s 
head on the cervix. 
L.3.1.2 
THE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR 
This is the "pushing" stage. It begins when the cervix is fully dilated and lasts until the birth of the 
baby.  When the cervix is fully dilated the woman in labour will be asked to push when she feels 
the need to do so during contractions.  
This stage of labour is hard work. This stage may take 1-2 hour. 
WHAT HAPPENS AT THE ACTUAL BIRTH? 
During the second stage, the baby’s head moves down the vagina until it can be seen. When 
the head is almost ready to come out, the woman in labour will be asked to stop pushing and 
to do a couple of quick short breaths, blowing out through the mouth. This is done so that the 
baby’s head can be born slowly and gently, giving the skin and muscles of the perineum (the 
area between the vagina and anus) time to stretch without tearing. The skin of the perineum 
usually stretches well, but it may tear. Afterwards, the cut or tear may be stitched up to help 
the healing process.  
Once baby’s head is born, most of the hard work is over. With one more gentle push, the body 
is born quite quickly and easily. The baby may be born covered with a white, greasy substance 
known as vernix, which has acted as protection in the uterus. 


  
265 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
L.3.1.3 
THE THIRD STAGE OF LABOUR – THE PLACENTA 
After the baby is born, more contractions will push out the placenta.  
The baby should be presented to the mother to be breastfed as soon after birth as possible. 
This helps with breastfeeding later on and it also helps the womb to contract. Babies start 
sucking immediately. However, this sometimes occurs just for a short period of time – they may 
just like to feel the nipple in their mouth.  
 
 


  
266 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
L.4 
AFTERCARE OF THE MOTHER 
The mother will be taken care of to recover from the labour as soon as possible. As the mother 
recovers after giving birth, following symptoms are not uncommon: 
 
Bloody vaginal discharge that changes to brown, then whitish over the next few 
weeks after delivery. 
 
Pain in perineal region. 
 
Painful contractions that may continue after delivery (as the uterus returns to its 
original size). 
 
Breast engorgement (as milk production begins). 
 
Fatigue, sorebreast and backache are common in the first few weeks. 
 
Piles (haemorrhoids) are common, but usually disappear after a few days. 
It is not uncommon for women to experience a "baby blues" period during the first days or 
weeks after delivery (most commonly seen occurring suddenly on the third or fourth day after 
delivery). These "baby blues" are characterized by the following symptoms, although each 
woman may experience symptoms differently: 
 
feelings of disappointment, 
 
crying with no known reason, 
 
irritability, 
 
impatience, 
 
anxiety, and 
 
restlessness 
It is common for these "baby blues" feelings to go away soon after onset and, in most cases, 
without treatment.  
These symptoms may also be present in case of a postpartum depression. Postpartum 
depression is a more severe form of “baby blues”. Women with postpartum depression may 
have trouble coping with their daily tasks.  
The following are the most common symptoms of postpartum depression; however, each 
woman experiences these symptoms differently: 
 
sadness, 
 
anxiety, 
 
hopelessness, 
 
fatigue or exhaustion, 
 
poor concentration, 
 
confusion, 
 
a fear of harming the new-born or herself,  
 
mood swings characterized by exaggerated highs and/or lows, 


  
267 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
diminished libido (sex drive), 
 
feelings of guilt, 
 
low self-esteem, 
 
uncontrolled crying and with no known reason, 
 
over concern/over attentiveness for the new-born or a lack of interest for the new-
born, 
 
appetite changes, 
 
sleep disturbances, 
 
resentment, 
 
memory loss, and 
 
feelings of isolation. 
While the exact cause for postpartum depression is unknown, it is likely that a number of 
different factors, such as the following, are involved: 
 
the changing of roles (as a spouse and new parent), 
 
hormonal changes during and after delivery, 
 
stress, 
 
personal or family history of mental illness, particularly postpartum depression, and 
 
marital strife. 
If you think someone may have postpartum depression, or if partner or family members are 
concerned about what the person does, it is important to refer the mother to her healthcare 
provider or healthcare facility as soon as possible. Do not let her wait until her next postpartum 
check-up.

MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND PREGNANCY 
Certain medical conditions may complicate a pregnancy. However, with proper medical 
care, most women can enjoy a healthy pregnancy, despite their medical challenges. It is 
important that the pregnant woman contacts her healthcare provider early. 
L.5.1 
DIABETES 
Diabetes in pregnancy can have serious consequences for the mother and the growing foetus. 
The severity of problems often depends on the severity of the mother's diabetic disease, 
especially if she has vascular (blood vessel) complications and poor blood glucose control.  
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the condition in which the glucose level is elevated and 
other diabetic symptoms appear during pregnancy in a woman who has not previously been 
diagnosed with diabetes. In most cases of GDM, all diabetic symptoms disappear following 
delivery. However, women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing 
diabetes later in life, especially if they were overweight before pregnancy. Unlike other types 
of diabetes, gestational diabetes is not caused by a lack of insulin, but by other hormones that 
block the insulin that is produced, a condition referred to as insulin resistance. 
L.5.2 
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 
High blood pressure can occur in pregnancy in two forms. It may be a pre-existing condition, 
called chronic hypertension, or it can develop during pregnancy -- a condition known as 
gestational hypertension. It is also called toxemia or preeclampsia/eclampsia and occurs most 
often in young women with the first pregnancy. It is more common in twin pregnancies, and in 
women who had blood pressure problems in a previous pregnancy. 
High blood pressure can lead to placental complications and slowed foetal growth. If 
untreated, severe hypertension may cause dangerous seizures and even death in the mother 
and foetus.  
Women who have high blood pressure before pregnancy often need to continue taking their 
antihypertensive medication. Such patients need to be managed by joint physician and 
gynaecologist care before conception and during pregnancy. Only the treating physician and 
the gynaecologist can give the correct advice on this. 
L.5.3 
INFECTIONS 
Infections during pregnancy can pose a threat to the foetus. Even a simple urinary tract 
infection or vaginal infection which is common during pregnancy, should be treated 
immediately. An infection that goes untreated can lead to preterm labour and rupture of the 
membranes surrounding the foetus. 
L.5.3.1 
FOOD POISONING (E.G. LISTERIOSIS)  
A pregnant woman should avoid eating undercooked or raw foods because of the risk of food 
poisoning. Food poisoning can dehydrate a mother and deprive the foetus of nourishment. 
L.5.3.2 
 CHLAMYDIA 
Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can infect both men and 
women. It can cause serious, permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system, making 
it difficult or impossible for her to get pregnant later on. Chlamydia infection is associated with 
tubal disease and tubal pregnancy (pregnancy that occurs outside the womb) which can be 
fatal. 


  
269 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Chlamydia--infections may be associated with premature labour and rupture of the 
membranes. New-borns can develop a chlamydia eye infection during childbirth, which may 
lead to blindness.  
The only way to avoid STDs is to not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If sexually active, the 
following things lower the chances of getting chlamydia: 
 
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has 
been tested and has negative STD test results; 
 
Using condoms the right way every time having sex. 
L.5.3.3 
HEPATITIS 
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting in liver cell damage and destruction. Several 
types of the hepatitis virus have been identified.  
The most common type that occurs in pregnancy is hepatitis B (HBV). This type of hepatitis 
spreads mainly through contaminated blood and blood products, sexual contact, and 
contaminated needles and syringes. Although HBV resolves in many people, some will develop 
chronic HBV infection.  
Hepatitis B virus can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. 
Infected pregnant women can transmit the virus to the foetus during pregnancy and at 
delivery. The later in pregnancy a mother contracts the virus, the greater the chance for 
infection in her baby. A very safe and effective vaccine is available against HBV infection. 
Using safe blood and safe needles and syringes will also prevent viral hepatitis B. 
 The only way to avoid sexual transmission is to not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If sexually 
active, the following things lower the chances of getting HBV: 
 
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has 
been tested and found negative for HBV; 
 
Using latex condoms the right way every time having sex. 
L.5.3.4 
HIV AND AIDS 
A woman with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has about one in four chance of infecting 
her foetus. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is caused by the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which kills or impairs cells of the immune system and progressively 
destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers.  
HIV is spread most commonly by sexual contact with an infected partner. HIV may also be 
spread through contact with infected blood, especially by sharing needles, syringes, or drug 
use equipment with someone who is infected with the virus.  
Some people may develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after exposure to the HIV virus, 
although many people do not develop any symptoms at all when they first become infected. 
Persistent or severe symptoms may not surface for 10 years or more, after HIV first enters the 
body in adults, or within two years in children born with an HIV infection. The term AIDS applies 
to the most advanced stages of an HIV infection.  
Using safe blood and safe needles and syringes will also prevent HIV/AIDS. The only way to 
avoid sexual transmission of STDs including HIV/AIDS is to not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. 
If sexually active, the following things lower the chances of getting HIV: 


  
270

 
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has 
been tested and found negative for HIV and other Sexually transmitted infections 
(STIs); 
 
Using latex condoms the right way every time having sex 
 
If a woman with HIV becomes pregnant she should be referred to concerned 
specialist and should be encouraged to get her viral loads and CD4 counts 
checked and should continue with medications.  
L.5.3.5 
GENITAL HERPES 
Herpes is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Genital 
herpes can be spread to the baby during delivery, if a woman has an active infection at that 
time.  
Herpes infections can cause blisters and ulcers on the mouth or face (oral herpes), or in the 
genital area (genital herpes). HSV is a life-long infection. Symptoms of HSV may include painful 
blisters or open sores in the genital area, which may be preceded by a tingling or burning 
sensation in the legs, buttocks, or genital region. The herpes sores usually disappear within a 
few weeks, but the virus remains in the body and the lesions may recur from time to time.  
It is important that women avoid contracting herpes during pregnancy, because a first episode 
during pregnancy creates a greater risk of transmission to the new-born. Genital herpes can 
cause potentially fatal infections in babies if the mother has active genital herpes (shedding 
the virus) at the time of delivery. Fortunately, infection of an infant is rare among women with 
genital herpes infection. Protection from genital herpes includes abstaining from sex when 
symptoms are present, and /or using latex condoms the right way every time having sex. 
L.5.3.6 
CMV (CYTOMEGALOVIRUS) 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the herpesviruses.  CMV is spread by close contact with a 
person who has the virus in his or her saliva, urine, or other body fluids.  
CMV can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her foetus during pregnancy. The virus in 
the mother’s blood crosses over the placenta and infects the fetus’ blood. Most babies with 
congenital (meaning present at birth) CMV infection never have health problems. But in some 
babies, congenital CMV infection causes health problems that may be apparent at birth or 
may develop later during infancy or childhood. 
A few simple steps can help to avoid exposure to saliva and urine that might contain CMV: 
 
Washing the hands often with soap and water for 40-60 seconds, especially after 
 
changing diapers, 
 
feeding a young child, 
 
wiping a young child’s nose or drool, or 
 
handling children’s toys. 
 
Do not share food, drinks, or eating utensils used by young children. 
 
Avoid contact with saliva when kissing a child. 
 
Clean toys, countertops, and other surfaces that come into contact with children’s 
urine or saliva.

TOXOPLASMOSIS 
Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled parasite named Toxoplasma gondii. 
Although many people may have toxoplasma infection, very few have symptoms because the 
immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. Babies who became infected 
before birth can be born with serious mental or physical problems. Toxoplasmosis often causes 
flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph glands, or muscle aches and pains that last for a few days to 
several weeks.  
The following measures can help prevent toxoplasmosis infection: 
 
Wear gloves when you garden or do anything outdoors that involves handling soil. 
Cats who may pass the parasite in their faeces, often use gardens. Avoid any 
contact with cat faeces. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water after 
outdoor activities, especially before you eat or prepare any food. 
 
Have someone who is healthy and not pregnant handle raw meat for you. If this is 
not possible, wear clean gloves when you touch raw meat and wash any cutting 
boards, sinks, knives, and other utensils that might have touched the raw meat. 
Wash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward. 
 
Cook all meat thoroughly, that is, until it is no longer pink in the center or until the 
juices run clear. Do not sample meat before it is fully cooked.

PREVENTION OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES (STD) 
L.6.1 
SEXUAL TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are passed from one person to another through 
unprotected sex.  
Some frequent STIs and STDs, in alphabetical order: 
L.6.1.1 
CHANCROID 
Chancroid is a small bump in the genital area which is infected with a bacteria known as 
Haemophilus ducreyi.  The bump is painful, soft and usually bursts and forms an ulcer within a 
day of its appearance. Along with this bump (or ulcer), small rubbery bumps (but different from 
the former) may also be felt in the crease between the belly and thigh. 
People infected with this bacteria spread it to others through sexual contact.  
L.6.1.2 
CHLAMYDIA 
Chlamydia is common and is easily passed on during sex. Most people don't experience any 
symptoms, so they are unaware they're infected. 
In women, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal 
discharge, pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and # BLEEDING bleeding during or after sex or 
between periods. It can also cause heavy periods. 
In men, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, cloudy or 
watery discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles. 
It's also possible to have a chlamydia infection in the rectum (bottom), throat or eyes. 
You can get chlamydia through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex or by contact with 
partner’s genitals, or sharing sex toys when they are not washed or covered with a new 
condom between each person who uses them. Sexual fluid from the penis or vagina can pass 
chlamydia from one person to another even if the penis does not enter the vagina, anus or 
mouth. This means you can get chlamydia from genital contact with someone who has the 
infection even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation. It isn’t clear if chlamydia could 
be passed on by transferring infected semen or vaginal fluid on the fingers, or by rubbing 
female genitals together. Chlamydia cannot be passed on through casual contact, including 
kissing and hugging, or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or cutlery. 
L.6.1.3 
DONOVANOSIS 
Donovanosis is a sexually transmissible genital ulcer disease. The bacterium that causes it is 
Klebsiella granulomatis. It infects the skin around the genitals, groin or anal area and causes 
ulcers and destruction of the skin. After infection, one or more initially painless ulcers (sores) or 
lumps develop on the genitals, or around the anus or mouth.  
Without treatment the ulcers will increase in size and can form a raised red fleshy lump that 
progressively destroys normal skin. Other bacteria can infect these sores, causing them to 
become painful and distressing with an unpleasant smell. 
Donovanosis is spread by sexual contact. Symptoms generally appear from 1-4 weeks after 
infection but occasionally may take as long as a year to develop. A very small proportion of 
people may be infected through direct, nonsexual contact (skin-to-skin contact). 


  
273 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
L.6.1.4 
GENITAL WARTS – HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV) 
Genital warts are small fleshy growths, bumps or skin changes that appear on or around the 
genital or anal area. They're caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). The warts are usually 
painless, but they may give some itching or redness. Occasionally, they can cause # BLEEDING bleeding. 
Genital warts can be spread during vaginal or anal sex, and by sharing sex toys. A person does 
not need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin-to-
skin contact. 
L.6.1.5 
GENITAL HERPES 
Genital herpes is a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is the 
same virus that causes cold sores. 
Some people develop symptoms of HSV a few days after coming into contact with the virus. 
Small, painful blisters or sores usually develop, which may cause itching or tingling, or make it 
painful to urinate. After a person is infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive) most of the 
time. However, certain triggers can reactivate the virus, causing the blisters to develop again, 
although they're usually smaller and less painful. 
Genital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex (vaginal, anal or oral) with an infected 
person. Even if someone with genital herpes doesn't have any symptoms, it's possible for them 
to pass the infection to a sexual partner. 
L.6.1.6 
GONORRHOEA 
Gonorrhoea is a STI easily passed on during sex caused by bacteria called Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae or gonococcus. About 50% of women and 10% of men don't experience any 
symptoms and are unaware that they are infected. 
In women, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal 
discharge (often watery, yellow or green), pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and 
# BLEEDING bleeding during or after sex or between periods, sometimes causing heavy periods. 
In men, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, yellow or 
green discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles. 
It's also possible to have a gonorrhoea infection in the rectum, throat or eyes. 
Gonorrhoea is easily passed between people through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex or 
by sharing sex toys that haven't been washed or covered with a new condom each time they 
are used. Gonorrhoea is not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing baths or towels, swimming 
pools, toilet seats, or sharing cups, plates and cutlery, because the bacteria can't survive 
outside the human body for long. 
L.6.1.7 
HEPATITIS B  
Hepatitis B is a type of virus that can infect the liver.  
Symptoms can include feeling sick, lack of appetite, flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, 
general aches and pains, and headaches, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). 
However, many people don't realise they have been infected with the virus because the 
symptoms may not develop immediately, or even at all. A mother can also pass on the hepatitis 
B infection to her new-born baby.  


  
274 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Hepatitis B can be spread through blood and body fluids such as semen and vaginal fluids, so 
it can be caught during unprotected sex, including anal and oral sex and by sharing needles 
and syringes. 
L.6.1.8 
HIV 
The HIV virus attacks and weakens the immune system, making it less able to fight infections 
and disease. There's no cure for HIV, but there are treatments that allow most people to live a 
long and otherwise healthy life. 
AIDS is the final stage of an HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening 
infections. 
Most people with HIV look and feel healthy and have no symptoms. When you first develop 
HIV, you may experience a flu-like illness with a fever, sore throat or rash. This is called a 
seroconversion illness.  
HIV is most commonly passed on through unprotected sex. It can also be transmitted by 
coming into contact with infected blood – for example, and sharing needles and syringes. 
L.6.1.9 
PUBIC LICE 
Pubic lice ("crabs" (because they look similar to crabs.)) are easily passed to others through 
close genital contact. They're usually found in pubic hair, but can live in underarm hair, body 
hair, beards and occasionally eyebrows or eyelashes. 
It may take several weeks for you to notice any symptoms. Most people experience itching, 
and you may notice the lice or eggs on the hairs. Pubic lice are sometimes called crab lice 
because they look similar to crabs. 
Pubic lice spread through close body contact with someone who has them. The lice crawl from 
hair to hair, but cannot fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so generally leave the 
body to move from one person to another. They are most commonly passed on during sexual 
contact. Condoms will not prevent them being passed to another person. It is also possible for 
pubic lice to be spread through sharing clothes, towels and bedding. 
L.6.1.10 
SCABIES 
Scabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It can be passed on through close 
body or sexual contact, or from infected clothing, bedding or towels. 
If a person develops scabies, he may experience an intense itching that's worse at night. The 
itching can be in the genital area, but it also often occurs between the fingers, on wrists and 
ankles, under the arms, or on the body and breasts. 
The infected person may have a rash or tiny spots. In some people, scabies can be confused 
with eczema. It's usually very difficult to see the mites. 
Scabies mites can be passed on through close body or sexual contact, or from infected 
clothing, bedding or towels. 
L.6.1.11 
SYPHILIS 
Syphilis is a bacterial infection (Treponema pallidum) that in the early stages causes a painless, 
but highly infectious, sore on the genitals or around the mouth. The sore can last up to six weeks 
before disappearing. 


  
275 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Secondary symptoms such as a rash, flu-like illness or patchy hair loss may then develop. These 
may disappear within a few weeks, after which you'll have a symptom-free phase. 
The late or tertiary stage of syphilis usually occurs after many years, and can cause serious 
conditions such as heart problems, paralysis and blindness. 
The syphilis bacteria can enter your body if you have close contact with an infected sore, 
normally during vaginal, anal or oral sex, or by sharing sex toys with someone who is infected. 
It may also be possible to catch syphilis by sharing needles for drug use with somebody who is 
infected. Pregnant women can pass the infection to their unborn baby. Syphilis also cannot be 
spread by using the same toilet, clothing, cutlery or bathroom as an infected person, as the 
bacteria cannot survive for long outside the human body. 
L.6.1.12 
TRICHOMONIASIS 
Trichomoniasis is an STI caused by a tiny parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). It can be 
easily passed on through sex and most people don't know that they're infected. 
In women, trichomoniasis can cause a frothy yellow or watery vaginal discharge that has an 
unpleasant smell, soreness or itching around the vagina, and pain when passing urine. 
In men, trichomoniasis rarely causes symptoms. You may experience pain or burning after 
passing urine, a whitish discharge, or an inflamed foreskin. 
The parasite is usually spread by having unprotected sex (without using a condom), although 
it can also be spread by sharing sex toys. You do not have to have many sexual partners to 
catch trichomoniasis. Anyone who is sexually active can catch it and pass it on. Trichomoniasis 
cannot be passed on through oral or anal sex, kissing, hugging, sharing cups, plates or cutlery, 
toilet seats or towels. 
L.6.2 
WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY? 
Any person who is  at risk and doubts he might be infected, if had unprotected sex with a 
potentially infected person or has been exposed to multiple sex partners should always be 
referred  to the nearest sexual health clinic or healthcare facility for a check-up as soon as 
possible. 
Sex workers should always be advised to have frequent regular check-ups. 
L.6.3 
REDUCING THE RISK OF STDS/STIS 
Effective strategies for reducing STD risk include: 
L.6.3.1 
ABSTINENCE SEX 
The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not to have sex, especially anal and oral sex.  
L.6.3.2 
MUTUAL MONOGAMY 
Mutual monogamy means to agree to be sexually active with only one person, who has 
agreed to be sexually active only with the same person.  
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner is one of 
the most reliable ways to avoid STDs.  


  
276 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
L.6.3.3 
CONDOMS 
 
Correct and consistent use of the male latex condom is highly effective in reducing STD 
transmission. Use a condom every time you have sex. 
L.6.3.4 
REDUCED NUMBER OF SEX PARTNERS 
Reducing the number of sex partners decreases the risk of STDs. It is important to get tested for 
STDs regularly. 
L.6.3.5 
VACCINATIONS 
Vaccines are safe, effective, and recommended ways to prevent hepatitis B and HPV. HPV 
vaccines for males and females can protect against some of the most common types of HPV. 
The person can discuss this option with his healthcare provider.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
L.7 
EMERGENCY CHILDBIRTH 
Pregnant women should always visit a health centre or another healthcare facility for 
pregnancy follow-up from the moment the woman notices she is pregnant. 
Expectant mothers usually reach the health centre on time, but there may be some situations 
where this is not possible, for instance in the last stages of pregnancy when an expectant 
mother can go into labour at any time. 
As a first aider you might be required to assist with the delivery of the baby during emergency 
childbirth. 
L.7.1 
WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? 
The following signs indicate that labour has started and the baby is about to be born: 
 
painful contractions occurring at increasingly shorter intervals, 
 
the waters break, 
 
blood mixed sticky discharge, 
 
abdominal discomfort, 
 
urge to push, or 
 
localised back pain. 
L.7.2 
WHAT DO I DO? 
ALL PREGNANT WOMEN MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO OPT FOR 
AN INSTITUTIONAL DELIVERY. 
L.7.2.1 
WHEN TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY DURING PREGNANCY?  
If at any time the mother feels the loss of foetal movement, feels sick or has concerns about 
her or the baby's health, she should visit the healthcare facility and consult a doctor. 
If any of the following symptoms show, the mother should go to the healthcare facility without 
any delay: 
 
fever and weakness or unable to get out of bed, 
 
pain in the belly and/or bad smelling discharge from the vagina, 
 
sudden # BLEEDING bleeding or increasing loss of blood, 
 
fits, 
 
difficulty in breathing, fast breathing or chest pain, 
 
irregular heartbeat, palpitations, 
 
terrible headache and blurry vision, 
 
nausea and vomiting, 
 
faintness or dizziness, 
 
swelling of the feet, 


  
278 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
labour that starts before 34 weeks of gestation, 
 
labour that lasts longer than 12 hours. 
If there is a healthcare facility in the area, it is best to arrange immediate transportation to take 
the woman there. If not, send for a trained birth attendant or health worker to help. 
L.7.2.2 
WHAT DO I DO IF THE WOMAN IS IN LABOUR OR IF THE WATERS HAVE BROKEN?  
If there is a healthcare facility in the area, it is best to arrange immediate transportation to take 
the woman there. If not, send for a trained birth attendant or health worker to help. 
L.7.2.3 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN I HAVE TO ASSIST IN AN EMERGENCY BIRTH? 
1. Encourage the expectant mother's companions and relatives to be involved.  
2. Praise and encourage the mother. 
3. Protect and respect her privacy and the local or religious customs. 
4. Wash your hands before assisting. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no 
soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can 
also be used, if available. 
5. Provide a reassuring touch to reduce anxiety 
 
6. Encourage the woman to move around and find the most comfortable position. 
7. Let her urinate often. A full bladder delays the process of labour and increases the 
chances of tearing and # BLEEDING bleeding. 
8. Permit sips of water to moisten the lips during labour. 
9. Encourage her to breathe out calmly and to relax with each breath. 
10. Seek immediate help if you notice the following complications: 
 
The baby is coming out with the hips or feet first, instead of his head. 
 
There are no contractions six hours after the waters break. 
 
The contractions continue for more than 12 hours. 
 
The woman is # BLEEDING bleeding and/or she has fever. 


  
279 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
L.7.2.4 
WHAT DO I DO DURING THE PUSHING STAGE? 
 
1. Support the woman in a comfortable position. 
An upright position is the best, but a lying position is the least challenging to assist 
with delivery. 
You can put a pillow under the right hip. 
2. Wash your hands with water and soap.  If no soap is available, you can use ash to 
wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
3. Put on (disposable) gloves or use a clean plastic bag to avoid contact with the 
bodily fluids. 
4. Naturally, at this stage, the mother feels the urge to push. 
If the pushing is not working, tell her to change position and to empty her bladder. 
Tell the mother not to push when the baby's head is out. 
 
5. Watch the baby come out while supporting the baby's head and shoulders. 
Do not pull the baby out. 
Do not push on the woman's belly during labour or after the delivery. 
L.7.2.5 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE BABY IS BORN? 
1. Immediately after birth, place the baby on the mother's bare chest or abdomen so 
that they can have skin-to-skin contact. 


  
280 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
2. To sterilise the cutting equipment, boil it for ten minutes or run it through a flame a 
few times and let it cool down. 
3. Cut the baby's cord: 
 
a. Create two knots/ties: 
1. The first knot/tie is two cm (about three fingers) away from the baby's 
abdomen. 
2. The second knot/tie is four cm (about five fingers) away from the first 
knot/tie. 
b. Cut between the two knots/ties with a clean razor blade, scissors or a knife. 
c. Create another knot/tie on the side of the baby's abdomen if the cord 
continues to bleed after it has been cut. 
d. Keep the cord dry and clean. 
4. Wipe the baby's skin clean and dry and ensure that the baby is kept warm and 
close to the mother. 
5. The baby can be dressed or wrapped. 
 
6. The placenta or afterbirth will come out naturally on its own. When it is out, put it 
somewhere safe until it can be disposed of properly. 


  
281 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
Do not pull on the umbilical cord to remove the placenta and afterbirth. If the cord 
rips, it may cause infection or severe # BLEEDING bleeding. 
7. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your 
hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
 
8. Encourage the mother to breastfeed the newborn. Although there is no breast milk 
at that moment, the baby's sucking will stimulate the production of milk. 
Immediate breast-feeding also helps the placenta to come out and prevents 
# BLEEDING bleeding of the mother after delivery. 
9. Encourage the mother to move around as soon as she feels able and ready to do 
so. 
10. Do not leave the mother unattended during the first 24 hours after giving birth. 
11. The mother should go to a healthcare facility for further check-up and 
management. 
L.7.2.6 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE BABY IS NOT BREATHING OR NOT BREATHING NORMALLY? 
1. Tell the mother that the baby is having problems breathing and that you will help. 
2. Move the baby on to a clean, dry and warm surface. 
3. Keep the baby wrapped and warm. 
4. Start CPR for the baby. 
5. Stop resuscitating after 20 minutes if the baby is not breathing or gasping for air and 
explain to the mother what has happened and offer her support. 
L.7.2.7 
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE MOTHER IS BLEEDING HEAVILY AFTER GIVING BIRTH? 
1. Call for help and arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or 
hospital. 
2. Massage the mother's belly firmly below the navel. This might slow down the 
# BLEEDING bleeding. 
3. Ask the mother to urinate if possible. This might slow down the # BLEEDING bleeding. 
L.7.2.8 
WHAT DO I DO AFTER ASSISTING THE EMERGENCY BIRTH? 
After birth, mother and baby should always be transported to a healthcare facility for 
further checkup and follow up.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
M.1 
DEFINITION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID 
It is a process of facilitating resilience within an individual to enable to bounce back from the 
impact of crisis and help him to deal with the event/crisis by respecting the independence, 
dignity and coping mechanism. 
In the past first aid was mainly focussed on giving physical first aid to an injured or suddenly sick 
person by someone who happens to be present when the accident happened or the illness 
occurred. 
Traumatic events and sickness may stress people. They might feel overwhelmed, worried, 
confused or feel uncertainness. Some people might show little or no signs, others might present 
with a more severe reaction.   
The SPHERE (2011) and IASC (2007) define psychological first aid (PFA) as a humane, supportive 
response to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may need support. It includes: 
 
providing practical care and support, which does not intrude; 
 
assessing needs and concerns; 
 
helping people to address basic needs (for example, food and water, information); 
 
listening to people, but not pressuring them to talk; 
 
comforting people and helping them to feel calm; 
 
helping people connect to information, services and social supports, and 
 
protecting people from further harm. 
Physical and psychological first aid go hand in hand and should be delivered simultaneously.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
M.2 
TRAUMATIC CRISIS 
 
A traumatic crisis is caused by a sudden, unexpected and intense incident.  
The event, as in following examples 
 
traffic accident, a fire, …; 
 
natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, …); 
 
serious illness; 
 
death of a close one; 
 
violence, robbery, attack, rape …; 
 
financial difficulties; 
 
relational difficulties; 
 
suicide (attempt); 
 
etc, 
produces a significant emotional # SHOCK shock that temporarily overwhelms the individual. 
The traumatic crisis will almost always follow a certain pattern. One may say that the traumatic 
crisis can be divided into four phases: 
1. (Psychological) Shock phase. 
2. Reaction phase. 
3. Processing phase. 
4. Reorientation phase. 
M.2.1 
(PSYCHOLOGICAL) SHOCK PHASE 
The # SHOCK shock phase follows immediately after the event which triggered the crisis. During the # SHOCK shock 
phase, the person is not yet able to comprehend the event that caused the crisis and may 
even deny it. While some people in # SHOCK shock become completely paralysed, others behave in a 
mechanical and cold way. Some people in # SHOCK shock may become strongly agitated; they may 
scream or cry furiously. People may also alternate between paralysis and restlessness states. 
The reactions of people in # SHOCK shock, such as apparent lack of feelings, may confuse the people 
close to them and even cause embarrassment or resentment.  
The # SHOCK shock phase may include:  
 
denial, 


  
285 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
emotional shutdown, 
 
feeling surreal and like an outsider, and 
 
shouting, crying and panic. 
Reactions during the (psychological) # SHOCK shock phase may seem scary and strange. 
M.2.2 
REACTION PHASE 
The immediate danger is over. The person will slowly face the tragic incident and try to 
understand what has happened. At the beginning of the reaction phase, people might 
experience strange and unexpected sensations; for example, they may feel that the person 
they have lost is still around or they may hear their voice somewhere.  
The feelings of people in the reaction phase are often very similar to each other and they are 
often expressed in the same form: "I think I’m going crazy", "I can’t take it any more", "will I ever 
make it through?", "life feels like a rollercoaster", or "will this pain last forever?", for example.  
The reaction phase may include: 
 
fear and anxiety, 
 
self-accusations and the need to find someone to blame, 
 
sleeplessness and loss of appetite, and 
 
nausea or other physical symptoms. 
During the reaction phase of a crisis, people often feel the need to be heard. They may feel 
the need to discuss the matter over and over again. This may feel very heavy and consuming 
to the people close to the individual.  
M.2.3 
PROCESSING PHASE 
In the processing phase, the person begins to understand what has happened. The matter is 
no longer denied; instead, the person understands that the incident and all its changes and 
losses are really true. The person is ready to face all the different aspects of the incident and 
the new personal situation.  He is aware of the changes caused by the crisis and often begins 
to analyse his own identity and personal convictions and beliefs. He begins to think beyond the 
event, but will not yet have strength to plan for the future. Nevertheless, the person is preparing 
to face the future.  He also regains the capability to better concentrate on everyday’s life. 
The processing phase may include: 
 
problems with memory and concentration, 
 
irritability, and 
 
withdrawal from social relationships. 
M.2.4 
REORIENTATION PHASE 
The crisis is over. The person is able to live with what has happened, and it is no longer constantly 
on his mind. Every once in a while, the pain will resurface but there is also joy in life; the person 
will be able to look to the future and regain confidence in life. 
Nevertheless, the course of a crisis is not always straightforward; for example, things reminding 
of the incident can bring back heavy thoughts, anxiety and other symptoms.

M.3 
HOW DO I PROVIDE (PSYCHOLOGICAL) FIRST AID? 
 
Life-saving first aid is a top priority. It is important to start with limiting the physical injuries. You 
must first and foremost give life-saving first aid where necessary, in order to make sure that the 
injured persons get to the hospital alive. Doing the best you can to limit the injuries as much as 
possible also has a very soothing effect on the injured ones, and on all others present: ‘There is 
someone who helps’. 
M.3.1 
BEHAVE CALMLY 
Behaving calmly has a very soothing effect on the casualties and the psychically affected 
persons. Calmness can be just as contagious as uneasiness. 
Behaving calmly is: 
 
Speaking quietly in a normal pitch. 
 
Focus the right amount of time on the person you are there to help, instead of 
running from one thing to the other. 
 
Showing clearly that you have time to take care of the affected person. 
 
Avoiding mentioning that it seems to take too long for the ambulance or other 
helping teams to arrive. 
M.3.2 
LISTEN TO THE AFFECTED PERSON 
The affected person must be given the opportunity to tell what he has experienced. This is 
called “Venting”. 
You must accept what he tells you, and you must not comment on it; only ask questions which 
make him enlarge upon the subject.  
Perhaps his account sounds quite unbelievable, but to him that is what he has experienced or 
thinks he has experienced. By telling about the experiences he gets a chance to recognize for 
himself that quite incredible things, which he thinks he has experienced and which make him 
frightened, are not true. This way he can get free of these fantasies.  
Venting experiences also has the result that he gets them sorted out and gets them placed in 
the proper succession in his memory. It makes it easier to endure having experiences emerging 
as a tangled series of frightening pictures which he cannot control at all. 
You should: 
 
Try to find a quiet place to talk, and minimize outside distractions. 
 
Respect privacy and keep the person’s story confidential, if this is appropriate. 


  
287 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Behave appropriately by considering the person’s culture, age and gender. 
 
Respect the person’s right to make his own decisions. 
 
Stay near the person but keep an appropriate distance depending on their age, 
gender and culture. 
 
Let them know you are listening; for example, nod your head or say “ hmmmm….” 
 
Be patient and stay calm. 
 
Be honest and trustworthy. 
 
Provide only factual correct information, if you have it. Be honest about what you 
know and don’t know. Say “I don’t know, but I will try to find out about that for you.” 
if you can’t answer the question.  
 
Give information in a way the person can understand and keep it. 
 
Acknowledge how he is feeling. 
 
If he tells you about any losses or important events, such as loss of the home or 
death of a loved one, reply with “I’m so sorry. I can imagine this is very sad for you.” 
 
Acknowledge the person’s strengths and how he has helped himself. 
 
Allow for silence. 
 
Make it clear to people that even if they refuse help now, they can still access help 
in the future. 
M.3.3 
GENERAL CONSIDERATION WHEN GIVING HELP 
Consider following basic topics when providing help or when you ask bystanders to give help: 
 
Get his personal belongings gathered. 
 
Find out where he is going. 
 
Find out how he got there. 
 
Make sure that there is someone who can take care of the affected one when he 
arrives at the destination. 
M.3.4 
PHYSICAL CONTACT 
It helps incredibly and creates an immediate sense of security, if you take the hand of the 
affected person or put an arm around his shoulder while you listen to him. If he cries - which in 
itself is very good for him - you can allow him to put his head on your shoulder. 
Physical contact is so important because the affected person # UNCONSCIOUS unconsciously will try to protect 
himself from the violent psychic trauma by reacting like a child. For this reason contact with a 
"grown-up" helper may help him to feel more secure.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
M.3.5 
ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE “HAVE A GOOD CRY” 
Crying is a strong outburst of feeling and a means of getting rid of extremely oppressive feelings. 
It is therefore very important to cry when the urge to do so arises. 
But crying is also very visible and audible expression of being affected by strong feelings and 
for some reason this is considered "embarrassing" in many culture. It is necessary that we set 
aside our culture constraints; when you are giving psychological first aid the affected person 
should be allowed to give way to his feelings. Tell him you understand this. 
M.3.6 
PROTECT AGAINST INQUISITIVE ONLOOKERS 
The affected person will be embarrassed showing his feelings, and he will, altogether, feel sorry 
to let other people see him in this particular situation. 
A person may react on the onlookers in different ways. He may try to hide himself in an "ostrich 
like" manner by holding his hands in front of his face, but he may just as well react very 
aggressively and abuse them. 
Your help must consist in getting the affected one away from the onlookers, or make them 
leave the area. 
M.3.7 
DO NOT LET THE AFFECTED PERSON BE ALONE 
Even if the affected person does not like to have people around him, it is not a good idea to 
leave him alone with his psychic crisis. His feelings will seem much more oppressive when he is 
alone with them. 
You have to make sure that someone else can stay with him, if you cannot continue to provide 
help. It is important that the person who stays with him knows what has happened, and what 
the situation is. It will also be of great advantage, if the helper who takes over, knows the basics 
of psychological first aid and provides the best humane support. 
M.3.8 
PROVIDING PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID TO ALL  
This means giving immediate emotional support to those who are physically injured, as well as 
to those who are not physically injured but might be psychologically impacted.  
Also, look after the confused, the lost, and those who are separated from families. Care for 
those who are left behind. Help them to be re-united with their relatives.  
Recovering from a psychological injury can take longer than recovering from a wound. The 
person may need your continuing support in the weeks ahead 
When there are mass casualties follow the instructions of the medical team in charge. 
M.3.9 
DON’T FORGET TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF  
Helping responsibly also means taking care of your own health and wellbeing.  
As a helper, you may be affected by what you experience in a crisis situation, or you or your 
family may be directly affected by the event. It is important to pay extra attention to your own 
wellbeing and be sure that you are physically and emotionally able to help others. Take care 
of yourself so that you can care best for others.  
If working in a team, be aware of the wellbeing of your fellow helpers as well.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
N.1 
EMERGENCIES AT SCHOOL 
Children are highly vulnerable to injuries and accidents. Usually these are only minor bruises 
and grazes, but sometimes the child may incur a severe accident resulting in # FRACTURE fracture, 
# BLEEDING bleeding, suffocation, fainting, # BURNS burns, drowning or electric # SHOCK shock (etc.).  
Also, a school staff member may suffer a heart attack or a respiratory disorder with which first 
aiders have to cope.  
Under these circumstances the first aider should be able to rise to the occasion, instead of 
getting nervous. There are several simple procedures anyone can learn and, if correctly and 
immediately applied, can make the difference between life and death. 
Children are liable to the same type of emergencies and injuries as adults in similar 
circumstances. Details on how to handle emergency cases are described in the various 
chapters of this training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always 
remains the same and includes the following: 
1. Assess the situation. 
2. Safety first. 
3. Alert and seek help. 
4. Provide first-aid. 
5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed. 
6. Hygiene. 
Training and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There 
is no substitute for proper training! 
The school management should ensure that: 
 
a well-equipped first aid room or station with the necessary materials is available, 
 
a trained first aider(s) is(are) available in the school or is on call, and 
 
in each class at least one child (preferably more) is trained in first aid. 
Having trained first aiders available is a great asset to the school at the time of emergency.  
It is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John 
Ambulance organize first aid trainings for teachers, staff and students. Make sure each school 
has a SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) for any disaster including violence by fellow 
students and others.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
N.2 
EMERGENCIES AT WORK 
A common injury in workshop and factories is a worker being stuck in or pinned down under 
the machinery. This can result in twisted limbs, lacerations, severe # BLEEDING bleeding and # FRACTURE fractures, and 
may lead to # SHOCK shock.   
In some cases it is not possible to extricate or release the victim easily. In all cases, the 
machinery should be stopped immediately, the power of the machine cut off and a person 
who is familiar with handling the machine or a senior foreman should be called to the scene.  
Most modern machines have automatic releasing devices. Eventually, machine parts may 
have to be dismantled to get access and release the casualty.  
The first aider must assess the situation, ensure the safety for himself and casualty, control any 
# BLEEDING bleeding, provide the necessary first aid, prevent # SHOCK shock and reassure the casualty. He 
continuously needs to observe the casualty’s condition. It is best to cover any injured or burned 
parts when possible. Provide CPR when needed, and arrange for immediate medical aid on 
site or transport to a healthcare facility or hospital. 
Details on how to handle this and other emergency cases are described in the various chapters 
of this training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always remains the 
same and includes the following: 
1. Assess the situation. 
2. Safety first. 
3. Alert and seek help. 
4. Provide first-aid. 
5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed. 
6. Hygiene. 
Training and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There 
is no substitute for proper training! 
The workshop or factory management should ensure that: 
 
a well-equipped first aid room or station with the necessary materials is available; 
 
a trained first aider(s) is (are) available in the workshop or factory, or is on call; 
 
preferably some workers (or all) are trained in first aid; and 
 
all the workers should be sensitized about possible hazards and help available. 
Having trained first aiders available at the workplace is a great asset to the workshop or factory 
at the time of emergency. 
In case of accidents in deep mines such as coal mines rescue work is also very important 
besides first aid and is to be arranged urgently. Only trained specialised rescuers with special 
safety devices can provide this. All mines have to arrange the continuous availability of these 
teams and the required rescue materials. 
It is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John 
Ambulance organize first aid trainings for workers, miners and laypeople.

N.3 
ROAD AND TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
On many occasions the victims of road side accidents remain lying on the spot without medical 
aid or any help of the public until the arrival of police, which in many cases may take time.  
The members of the public do not basically have an indifferent attitude in such situation, but 
they have a fear that instead of receiving credit for helping the injured or by transporting him 
to a medical facility or hospital, there might be harassment by the police who might look to 
them with suspicion. They may also feel that they will have to bear the expenditure of the 
transportation.  
This thinking is not correct. A person who is lying helpless can be relieved from sufferings if 
someone provides the appropriate first aid and transport him to the nearest medical facility. 
Even a little knowledge of first aid of trained laypeople can save lives. 
To overcome this difficulty and to create public awareness of the moral duty to help, the 
government, the court and the police have been issuing instructions via the press, posters and 
radio- and TV-spots that members of public are to be given a positive response in their noble 
task helping and transporting the injured at the earliest to the healthcare facility or hospital for 
further medical aid. Instructions have also been given to police staff to ensure that such persons 
who bring an injured to the hospital for medical aid are not be detained. It should suffice for 
the emergency centres in hospitals to ask only following questions to the person who brings the 
injured to the hospital:  
1. Where have you brought this casualty from? 
2. Do you know anything about the cause of the injury of the casualty? 
3. May I have your particulars? 
It is likely that the person would answer the first question, but may not be able to answer the 
second one. He might hesitate to answer to the third question, in which case it should not be 
insisted upon. The escorts should, under no circumstances be detained in the hospital for 
interrogation. On the other hand he should be treated with courtesy. 
However, rendering aid to the injured is the moral and civil duty of each and every one of us. 
Details on how to handle these emergency cases are described in the various chapters of this 
training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always remains the same and 
includes the following: 
1. Assess the situation. 
2. Safety first. 
3. Alert and seek help. 
4. Provide first-aid. 
5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed. 
6. Hygiene. 
Training and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There 
is no substitute for proper training! 
Having trained first aiders available is always a great asset to the public at the time of 
emergency.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
In air crash or railway accidents, comprehensive skilled medical facilities are made available 
by the concerned authorities. The instructions issued by these teams are to be followed. 
It is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John 
Ambulance organize first aid trainings for commercial drivers, driving schools and laypeople. 
Emergency telephone numbers (for example, police, fire, ambulance etc.) should be 
repeatedly displayed at important places and in media.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
N.4 
EMERGENCIES IN RURAL AREA 
Medical facilities are often inadequately available, especially in the remote villages. It is also 
difficult to transport the injured or sick persons due to difficult roads or the non-availability of 
proper transport services. A charpai could be used in the village in place of stretcher.  
In rural areas following specific types of injuries are frequent:  
 
Fall from a tree or fall of a branch onto a victim (people have the habit to sit or 
sleep under the shade of trees in the summer). 
 
Fall from walls or roofs. The roofs of houses in villages have usually no parapet walls 
and children may fall from the roof. 
 
Collapsing of mud walls or roofs of houses onto people. 
 
Caving in of mud while digging and getting buried under the mud. 
 
Fall from horseback, or getting kick of a horse or donkey or other animals. 
 
Fall from a jhulah (suspension bridge) when the rope snaps. 
 
Drowning in the village pond, well or in canal water. 
 
Railway track accident (when walking on or crossing a railway line or when sitting 
or hanging on a wagon). 
 
Being crushed under a bus, car, tractor or other vehicles. 
 
Boat disasters. 
 
Bites of snakes, scorpions, leeches, dogs (rabies!), monkeys, tigers, jackal or camels. 
 
Heat stroke, heat exhaustion and hyperthermia. 
 
Frostbite in hilly areas. 
 
Food poisoning. 
 
Poisoning by DDT or other insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers. 
 
Cut from sharp agricultural equipment. (“thresher injuries”) 
 
Electrocution from electric wires, especially over-head high tension wires. 
 
Bums of various degrees 
 
Acute febrile illness (e.g. malaria)  
 
Acute diarrhoeal diseases leading to dehydration (e.g. cholera). 
 
Lathi blow, stone throwing, stab wound, kirpan (or other sharp weapon) wound or 
gunshot wound as a result of fighting between rival groups. 
 
Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning by sleeping in a room where sigri is kept burning 
especially at night, when room is kept closed and there is no ventilation  
 
Tetanus infection from wound etc. 
Many of these problems can be handled by a trained first aider in the initial stage. 
Training and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There 
is no substitute for proper training!

DISASTERS AND MULTIPLE CASUALTY ACCIDENTS 
India is such a vast country that some part is affected by flood, drought, cold, heat-wave, fire, 
earthquake, vehicle or train accidents … at any given time. These incidents can cause huge 
losses from collapsed buildings, damaged crops to large number of human casualties. 
Sometimes disasters strike suddenly. 
Rendering of first aid to the victims affected by a disaster is a very important relief activity and 
is a part of the first aid training programmes. Mass casualty management stresses the 
importance of the role of first responders and first aiders in disaster relief and counts on their 
preparedness to respond to emergency situations. 
In recent years, there has been renewed realizations that the people who become victim of 
injury or sudden illness need not only immediate attention but also proper medical care. Thus, 
it is imperative that first aid training and practice should keep pace with modem medical 
advancements.  
Unfortunately, many human lives are lost or disturbed by disasters and accidents. These stressful 
life events should be supported by appropriate and timely psychological aid. It is very 
important that someone is helping in making necessary arrangements, giving practical advice, 
listening to the grievances, assuaging the feelings and providing physical comfort by being 
with them. It is also important to educate victims about stress reactions and where to refer to 
for further help. These tasks do not require a psychologist, but trained first aiders can assist 
supporting these victims. 
For smooth working at a disaster or mass casualty accident site the first aiders need to:  
 
Have the appropriate knowledge and training in first aid and disaster 
management. 
 
Have the capability to think practically and be able to improvise, if required. 
 
Obtain the full particulars nature of the accident or disaster and the affected site. 
 
Coordinate with the appropriate governmental authorities. 
 
Coordinate with other local agencies, other institutions or organizations. 
 
List the resources (transport capacity, available medical personnel, available  first 
responders and first aiders, stand by medical equipment, available medication 
supplies, available equipment and disaster relief materials,  etc.) he has at his 
disposal and have an estimate how fast he can mobilize these resources. 
 
Obtain permission to act from the superior officer on site. 
 
Survey the site, the situation and the security risks. 
 
Survey the casualties. 
 
Allot the priorities for treatment and transport of the casualties. 
 
Provide the necessary assistance. 
 
Treat and transport the casualties to the assigned medical facilities. 
 
Submit a daily report to the concerned authorities and to his organization. 
 
Submit on completion of the mission a detailed final report to the concerned local 
authorities as well as his St. John Ambulance Headquarters or to his Red Cross 
Society along with his observations and suggestions.

EMERGENCY TRIAGE 
Triage is derived from the French trier, meaning ‘to sort or sieve’. In medicine, this is the process 
of sorting patients in order of priority for treatment and evacuation. Triage may take many 
different forms, and operates at a number of different levels. However, it aims to give the right 
patient the right care at the right time in the right place. 
In certain circumstances, this may also mean ‘doing the most for the most’. Originally 
developed for use in military conflicts, triage is equally applicable to civilian disasters and in 
day-to-day emergency settings. Accurate triage allows correct identification of those patients 
who need the most urgent intervention, as well as quickly and safely identifying those who can 
wait longer for treatment. The latter are the majority at a typical major incident. Triage may 
also be used to identify patients who are so severely injured that they will not survive, or whose 
treatment will tie up resources that would be best used for other patients. 
Triage is dynamic ‒ as the patient’s condition progresses, so his/her need for intervention alters, 
and the triage category will change. 
The casualties are classified in different categories: 
Category  
RED 
(U1 or I) 
YELLOW 
(U2 or II) 
GREEN 
(U3 or III) 
BLACK 
Urgency

TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Please note: 
 
There is a fifth category: the non-wounded (sometimes tagged ‘BLUE’).  They are 
victims of the incident but seem not to be injured. 
 
Inside each category, i.e. the categories RED and YELLOW, all casualties of the 
same are again ‘categorized by urgency’. For example, casualties with difficult 
breathing in category YELLOW will be attended first before patients in the same 
category with a better condition. 
 
Triaging is a snapshot of the moment the victim has been evaluated. Victims of one 
category can move in between categories. For example, a patient in category 
GREEN was walking around, but due to an internal # BLEEDING bleeding his condition 
deteriorates and he becomes a category YELLOW, even RED, depending on his 
‘new’ condition.  
 
In a mass casualty incident assigning the triage category is done very quickly. The 
category ‘BLACK’ (deceased) may be assigned to all casualties that are not 
breathing without even a CPR attempt (as incident is so massive and there are too 
many casualties that have to be attended with very limited resources). When more 
help arrives, and if the situation allows, these victims might be re-evaluated.  
 
In most mass casualty disasters, a zone for the RED (U1), YELLOW (U2) and GREEN 
(U3), the deceased (BLACK) and non-wounded (BLUE) will be assigned.  
 
Always make sure somebody is also observing the casualties in the GREEN zone and 
the non-wounded (BLUE) as some signs and symptoms of an injury may only show 
over time. 


  
300 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
Always follow the directives of the medical team on place or of the leader in 
charge. He assigns people to perform the triage, to assist in the different triage 
zones, or who will be responsible for managing the transport capacity, etc.

FIRST AID TECHNIQUES:  DRESSINGS, BANDAGES AND 
TRANSPORT TECHNIQUES 
In this chapter you will learn about: 
 Dressings. 
 Bandages. 
 Fast evacuation techniques (single rescuer). 
 Transport techniques. 
 
 


  
302 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.1 
DRESSINGS  
A dressing is a protective covering applied to a wound to: 
 
prevent infection, 
 
absorb discharge, 
 
control # BLEEDING bleeding, 
 
avoid further injury, and 
 
reduce pain. 
An efficient dressing should be sterile (germ free) and have a good degree of porosity to allow 
for oozing and sweating. 
O.1.1 
TYPES OF DRESSINGS 
O.1.1.1 
ADHESIVE DRESSINGS (BAND AID) 
These sterile dressings consist of a pad of absorbent gauze of cellulose held in place by a layer 
of adhesive material. Sterile adhesive dressings are supplied in paper or plastic covers. 
The surrounding skin must be dry before application and all the edges of the dressing pressed 
firmly down.  
O.1.1.2 
NON ADHESIVE DRESSING 
O.1.1.2.1 
READY-MADE STERILE DRESSING 
The dressing consists of layers of gauze covered by a pad of cotton wool and with an attached 
roller bandage to hold it in position. The dressing is enclosed and sealed in protective covering 
(which is only broken while applying) and is supplied in various sizes. 
O.1.1.2.2 
GAUZE DRESSING 
Gauze in layers is commonly used as a dressing for large wounds, as it is very absorbent, soft 
and pliable. It is liable to adhere to the wound; however, it may assist the clotting of blood. The 
dressing should be covered by one or more layers of cotton wool. 
O.1.1.3 
IMPROVISED DRESSING 
These can be formed from any clean soft absorbent material such as a clean handkerchief, a 
piece of linen, a clean paper, or cellulose tissue. They should be covered and retained in 
position. 


  
303 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.1.2 
HOW DO I APPLY A DRESSING? 
You should cover a wound with a dressing as this helps to prevent infections.  
Hygiene always comes first! Always wash your hands. 
Wash your hands before and after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash 
your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based 
sanitizers can also be used, if available. 
Put on gloves if available. You can also use a clean plastic bag. Try not to come in contact 
with the person’s blood and other body fluids. 
The dressing must be covered with adequate pads of cotton wool, extending well beyond 
them and retained in position by a bandage or strapping. 
 
 


  
304 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.2 
BANDAGES 
A bandage is a fairly long strip of material such as gauze used to protect, immobilize, compress, 
or support a wound or injured body part. 
There are a number of different first aid uses for bandages: they can be used to secure 
dressings, control # BLEEDING bleeding, support and immobilize limbs, reduce pain, and control swelling in 
an injured part. These are made from flannel, calico and elastic net or special paper.  
If you have no bandage available, you can improvise one from an everyday item; for example, 
you can fold a square of fabric, such as a headscarf, diagonally to make a triangular bandage, 
and a roller bandage if further folded. A belt, tie or some other materials can also be used as 
an improvised bandage. 
Bandages should be applied firm enough to keep dressing and splints in position, but not as 
tight as to cause injury to the part or to impede the circulation of the blood. A bluish tinge of 
the finger or nails may be a danger sign indicating that the bandage is too tight. Loss of 
sensation is another sign; such bandages should be loosened or removed quickly. 
O.2.1 
TYPES OF BANDAGES 
There are several types of bandages.  
 
Triangular bandages (also referred to as “master bandage”) can be 
used as large dressings, or as slings, to secure dressings or to 
immobilize limbs. 
 
Roller and crepe bandages secure dressings and support injured 
limbs.  
 
Tubular bandages hold dressings on fingers or toes or support injured 
joints.  
O.2.1.1 
TRIANGULAR BANDAGES 
 
A triangular bandage is made by cutting a piece of calico about 100 cm square from corner 
to corner giving two triangular bandages.  
It has three borders. The longest is called the “base” and the other two the “sides”. There are 
three corners. The one opposite the base is called the “point” and the other two are called the 
“ends”. While applying a triangular bandage, the point always moves first.   
 
 


  
305 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
 
 
Also a “reef knot” is always tied to enable easy loosening, tightening or opening. 
O.2.1.2 
SLINGS   
Slings are used to: 
 
support injured arms; 
 
prevent pull by upper limb to injuries of chest, shoulder and neck, and 
 
secure splints when applied.  
O.2.1.2.1 
ARM SLING (LARGE ARM SLING, TRIANGULAR ARM SLING WITH UNDERARM HORIZONTAL) 
The large arm sling is used in cases of injuries of arm, wrist and hands after application of 
dressing and/or splints, plaster casts and bandaging. 
To apply an arm sling: 
1. Face the casualty, hold the bandage point firmly, put one end of the spread 
triangular bandage over the uninjured shoulder with point towards the elbow of the 
injured side. 
2. Pass the end around the neck and bring it over the injured side shoulder. The other 
end will now be hanging down over the chest. 
3. Place the forearm horizontally across the chest at 90° and bring the hanging end 
up. The forearm is now covered by the bandage. 
 
4. Tie the two ends in such a way that the forearm is horizontal or slightly tilted upward 
and the knot (reef knot) is placed in the pit above the collar-bone. 
5. Hold the point with one hand & the bandage at little finger with the other and 
stretch it tight to check for any object like Bangle, watch or metal ring etc. beneath 
the bandage. 
6. Tuck the part of the sling point which is loose at the elbow behind the elbow and 
bring the fold to the front and pin it up to the front of the bandage. 
7. Place the free base of the bandage in such a way that its margin is just at the base 
of the nail of the little finger. The nails of all the fingers should be exposed.

8. Inspect the nails to find if there is any bluish colour. A bluish colour shows that there 
is a dangerous tightening of splints or plasters and therefore, free flow of blood is 
not possible. 
9. If the casualty is not wearing a coat, place a soft pad under the neck portion of 
the sling to prevent rubbing of the skin in that place. 
O.2.1.2.2 
COLLAR ‘N’ CUFF SLING 
This sling is only used to support the wrist. 
 
To apply a collar-N-cuff sling: 
1. The elbow is bent; the forearm is placed across the chest in such a way that the 
fingers point the opposite shoulder. In this position the sling is applied. 
2. A clove hitch is made with narrow bandage. Two loops are made and are laid on 
top of the other, the front loop is laid behind the back loop without turning. 
3. A clove-hitch is passed round the wrist and the ends tied in the neck pit above the 
collarbone on the injured side.  
O.2.1.2.3 
TRIANGULAR SLING (WITH UNDERARM UPWARDS)  
A triangular sling is used to support the # FRACTURE fracture of the collar bone, arms or injured shoulder, and 
also crushed or badly burned palms. It helps to keep the hand raised high up giving relief from 
pain due to the # FRACTURE fracture. 
 
To apply a triangular sling: 
1. Place the forearm across the chest with the fingers pointing towards the opposite 
shoulder, touching the collar bone and the palm over the breast-bone. 


  
307 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
2. Place an open bandage over the arm/chest, with one end over the hand and the 
point beyond the elbow. 
3. Tuck the base of the bandage comfortably under the forearm and hand.       
4. Fold the lower end also around the elbow and take it up and across the back of 
the shoulder (uninjured side) and tie it into the hollow above the collar bone by 
using a reef knot. 
5. Tuck the fold so formed backwards over the lower half of the arm and fix it with a 
safety pin. 
O.2.1.3 
BANDAGES 
A triangular bandage can be used as: 
 
 
a whole cloth (spread out fully) or called “open bandage”  
 
 
one fold” 
 
 
a broad bandage (two folds): 
Bring the point to the center of the base and then fold again in the same direction to 
create a broad bandage. Fold the bandage once again to make it a narrow 
bandage.  
A broad bandage can also be used as a roller bandage of approximately 6 inches 
(about 14 cm) size. 
 
 
a narrow bandage (three or more folds): 
When a smaller size bandage is needed fold the original so as to bring the ends 
together. The size is now reduced by half the original.  


  
308

O.2.2 
ROLLER BANDAGES 
 
 
Roller bandages are used in hospitals and first aid posts. They are made out of cotton material 
with loose mesh. They are of various lengths and widths. 
Used for 
Width in cm 
Width in inch 
Finger 
2 
1 
Hand 
5  
2 
Arm 
5 or 6 
2 or 2.5 
Leg 
7.5 or 9 
3 or 3.5 
Trunk 
10 or 15 
4 to 6 inch 
Roller bandages are also meant to keep dressings in position. The rolled part is called the 
“drum” or “head”, the unrolled portion the “tail”.  
Roller bandages should be applied firmly and evenly. 
To apply a roller bandage, always: 
1. Face the patient. 
2. Always keep the “tail” of the bandage towards the patient and the “head or drum” 
towards you. 
3. When bandaging left limb, hold the head of the bandage in the right hand and 
vice versa. 


  
314 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
4. Apply the outer surface of the bandage over the pad and wind it around the injury 
twice so that it is firm. 
5. Bandage from below upwards over the limb. Also make it a rule to apply bandage 
from the inner side to the outer side. 
6. Check that the bandage is neither too loose nor too tight. 
7. Roll bandage so that each layer covers two thirds of the earlier layer. 
8. Fix the bandage by pinning it up or using adhesive plaster. The usual practice of 
tearing the final end into two long tails and tying them up is quite satisfactory and 
practical. 
There are four methods of applying roller bandages as follows: 
O.2.2.1 
SINGLE OR SIMPLE SPIRAL 
PICTURE CHANGE 
The roller bandage is applied in a simple spiral. This is used on fingers or other uniform surfaces. 
The bandage is just carried around in spirals. 
O.2.2.2 
REVERSE SPIRAL 
 
This is a modified spiral in which the roll is reversed downwards on itself at each round. This 
technique should be used where the thickness of the part varies such as a leg, forearm, etc.  
O.2.2.3 
FIGURE OF EIGHT 
 
In this, the bandage is applied obliquely alternative up and down, so that the loops appear 
like the figure of eight.  It is used for joints like the elbow, knee etc.  


  
315 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.2.2.4 
SPICA 
 
This is a modified figure-of-eight, and is usefull for bandaging the hip, shoulder, groin or tumb. 
O.2.3 
CREPE BANDAGES 
These are roller bandages made of elastic cotton weaving material. These are used to support 
sprains or other soft tissue injuries where there is no wound. These serve the purpose of 
supporting the injured joints and also help in reducing the pain and swelling.  
These can be applied directly on the skin. The techniques of application are same as a roller 
bandage. These should not be applied too tightly. 


  
316 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.3 
FAST EVACUATION TECHNIQUES (SINGLE RESCUER) 
In case the casualty is in a dangerous situation following are possible one-rescuer evacuation 
techniques to move an # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious casualty over a very short distance to get him into safety. 
Only attempt to rescue a casualty if the scene is safe for yourself! 
O.3.1 
SHOULDER PULL 
 
1. Grasp the casualty by the clothing under the shoulders.  
2. Keep your arms on both sides of the head and support the head. 
3. Try to pull the casualty in a straight line, if possible. 
O.3.2 
ANKLE PULL 
 
This method is the fastest method to move a casualty over a short smooth distance. However 
it is not a preferred method as the head is unsupported and may bounce over the surface 
bumps. 
1. Grasp the casualty by both ankles and pant cuffs. 
2. Pull the casualty. Use your legs to apply force to pull, not your back. Keep your back 
as straight as possible. 
3. Pull the casualty in a straight line if possible. 
4. If the casualty is lying on a sheet, a plastic or a blanket, pull the same as per 
convenience.

TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.4 
TRANSPORT TECHNIQUES 
After appropriate first aid has been given, the patient may need to be transported. 
Keep following guidelines in mind when transporting a casualty: 
 
The position assumed by the casualty or in which he has been placed, should not 
be disturbed unnecessarily.  
 
Throughout the transport a careful watch must be kept on: 
 
the general condition of the casualty (breathing, consciousness); 
 
any dressing that may have been applied; 
 
any recurrence of haemorrhage, and 
 
any signs of changes or worsening of the casualty’s condition. 
 
The transport must be safe, steady and speedy. 
The injured or sick person may be moved to a shelter, medical facility or hospital by: 
 
a single helper; 
 
hand seats and the ’kitchen-chair’ carry technique by multiple helpers; 
 
blanket lift by multiple helpers; 
 
stretcher by multiple helpers; 
 
wheeled transport (ambulance, car, …); or 
 
air and sea travel (with specially trained staff). 
The method to be used (and it may be necessary to use more than one technique) may 
depend on: 
 
the nature and severity of the injury; 
 
the number of helpers and facilities available; 
 
the distance to the shelter, medical facility or hospital; and 
 
the nature of route to be covered. 
O.4.1 
SINGLE HELPER TRANSPORT. 
If you are the only person available, following techniques can be used to transport a casualty: 
 
the cradle technique, 
 
the human crutch technique, 
 
the pick-a-back technique, or 
 
the fire man's lift and carry technique 
 


  
318 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.4.1.1 
CRADLE TECHNIQUE 
This technique is only to be used in the case of light casualty or children. 
Lift the casualty by passing one of your arms well beneath his two knees and the other round 
his back. 
O.4.1.2 
HUMAN CRUTCH TECHNIQUE 
Standing at his injured side except where there is injury to an upper limb, assist the casualty by 
putting your arm round his waist, grasping the clothing at him and placing his arm round your 
neck, holding his hand with your free hand. 
If his upper limbs are injured and his other hand is free, the casualty may gain additional help 
from a staff or walking stick. 
If both legs are injured, another first aider might hold the other side in a similar way (see human 
crutch technique with two helpers).  
 
 
 


  
319 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.4.1.3 
PICK-A-BACK TECHNIQUE 
 
 
If the casualty is conscious and able to hold, he may be carried in the ordinary “pick-a-back" 
fashion. 
O.4.1.4 
FIREMAN'S LIFT AND CARRY TECHNIQUE  
To be used only when the casualty is not heavy for the bearer. 
1. Help the casualty to rise to upright position.  
2. Grasp his right wrist with your left hand. 
3. Bend down with your head under his extended right arm so that your right shoulder 
is level with the lower part of his abdomen and place your right arm between or 
around his legs.  
4. Taking his weight on your right shoulder come to the erect position.  
5. Pull the casualty across both shoulder and transfer his right wrist to your right hand, 
so leaving your left hand free. This allows the helper also to move up or down a 
ladder whilst carrying the casualty. 
 
 


  
320 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.4.2 
MULTIPLE HELPER TRANSPORT. 
When multiple helpers are available, following transport techniques can be used. 
O.4.2.1 
HUMAN CRUTCH TECHNIQUE 
Standing at both sides of the casualty, both helpers assist the casualty by putting their arm 
round his waist, grasping the clothing at him and placing each of his arm on their side around 
their neck, holding his hand with their free hand. 
O.4.2.2 
HAND SEAT TECHNIQUES 
Also known as the four-handed seat technique. This seat is used when the casualty can assist 
the bearer by using one or both arms. 
1. Two bearers face each other behind the casualty and grasp their left wrists with 
their right hands and each other's right wrist their left hands. 
2. The casually is instructed to place one arm around the neck of each bearer so that 
he may raise himself to sit on their hands and steady himself during transport. 
3. The bearers rise together and step off, the bearer on the right hand side of the 
casually with the right foot and the left hand bearer with the left foot. 
4. The bearers walk with the cross-over step and not by side paces. 


  
321 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.4.2.3 
THE TWO-HANDED SEAT TECHNIQUE 
This seat is mostly used to carry a casualty who is unable to assist the bearers by using his arms. 
1. Two bearers face each other and stoop down (not kneel) one on each side of the 
casualty.  
2. Each bearer passes his forearm nearest the casualty's head under his back just 
below the shoulders and if possible takes hold of his clothing. 
3. They slightly raise the casualty's back and then pass their other forearms under the 
middle of his thighs and grasp their hands, the bearer on the left of the casualty 
with his palm upwards and holding a folded handkerchief to prevent hurting by the 
finger nails; the bearer on the right of the casualty with his palm downwards, as 
shown in (“hook grip”). 
4. The bearers rise together and stoop off, the right- hand bearer with the right foot 
and the left-hand bearer with the left foot. 
5. The bearers walk with the cross-over step and not by side paces. 
 
 


  
322 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.4.2.4 
THE FORE AND AFT METHOD TECHNIQUE 
 
This method of carrying should be used only when space does not permit a hand seat.  
1. One bearer stands between the casualty's legs, facing the feet with hands down 
and grasps the casualty under his knees.  
2. The other bearer takes a position behind the casualty and after raising his trunk 
passes his hands under the casualty's armpits and grasps his own wrists on the 
casualty's chest.  
3. The casualty is then lifted.  
4. The bearers walk in step. 
5. A chair can be used also to carry the casualty when negotiating a narrow passage 
or moving up/down the stairs (see kitchen-chair carry technique). 
 
O.4.2.5 
THE KITCHEN-CHAIR CARRY TECHNIQUE 
The bearers walk in step by carrying the patient in a chair. Use this method when the casualty 
is light weight and the distance is small.  
This technique allows to climb up or down steps or stairs whilst carrying the casualty. 


  
323 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.4.2.6 
BLANKET LIFT TECHNIQUE 
 
1. Place the casualty on to a blanket: 
a. Place the blanket or rug on the ground in line with the casualty, and rolled 
lengthwise for half its width. 
b. Place the roller portion of the blanket or rug close to the casualty's back and 
gently rolls him over the roll until he is lying on his opposite side.  
2. If the casualty is suspected to have suffered a head, neck or spine injury or a 
# FRACTURE fracture, two bearers maintain control of the head and lower limbs. The other 4-6 
bearers very carefully turn the casualty on to his side every precaution being taken 
against movement at the site of the # FRACTURE fracture. The bearers at the head and at the 
lower limbs conform to the rolling of the casualty throughout. 
3. Unroll the rolled portion of the blanket or rug gently lowering the casualty on his 
back so that he lies on the centre of the open blanket or rug.  
4. During lifting by a blanket, the edges are rolled up close to the casualty's sides and 
lifted by two or three persons on either side. 


  
324 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.4.2.7 
THREE PERSON CARRY AND STRETCHER LIFT  
1. Each person kneels on the same knee nearest the victim's feet.  
2. On the command of the person at the head, the rescuers lift the victim up and rest 
the victim on their knees.  
3. If the patient is being placed on a low stretcher or litter basket: On the command 
of the person at the head, the patient is placed down on the litter basket/stretcher. 
4. If the victim is to be carried: At this point, the rescuers will rotate the victim so that 
the victim is facing the rescuers, resting against the rescuers' chests.  
5. On the command of the person at the head, all the rescuers will stand.  
6. To walk, all rescuers will start out on the same foot, walking in a line abreast. 
7. Special care has to be taken in case of suspected backbone or neck injuries (see 
also section O.6). 
 
 
 


  
325 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.5 
STRETCHERS 
Stretchers are of two patterns viz. “ordinary" and “telescopic-handled". In general principle 
they are similar. 
 
A stretcher consists of following parts 
 
poles,  
 
handles,  
 
jointed traverses,  
 
runners,  
 
bed,  
 
pillow-sack, and  
 
slings.  
The 'head' and 'foot' of a stretcher correspond to the head and feet of the casualty. 
At the head of the stretcher may be a canvas overlay (the pillow sack) which can be filled with 
straw, hay, clothing etc. to form a pillow. The pillow- sack opens at the head and its contents 
can therefore be adjusted without due disturbance of the casualty.  
The traverses are provided with joints for opening or closing the stretcher.  
The telescopic-handled pattern is similar but its length can be reduced to 6 feet by sliding the 
handles underneath the poles. This is of a great value when working in confined space, or when 
a casualty has to be taken up or down a narrow stair-case with sharp turns. 
When closed, the poles of the stretcher lie close together, the transverse bars being bent 
inwards, the canvas bed neatly folded on the top of the poles and held in position by the slings, 
which are laid along with canvas and secured by a strap which is placed transversely at the 
end of each sling and passed through the large loop of the other, and round the poles and 
bed. 
O.5.1 
LOADING A STRETCHER 
Two methods are used to load a patient on a stretcher: 
 
blanket lift, and 
 
emergency lift. 
 


  
326 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.5.1.1 
BLANKET LIFT  
1. In the blanket lift, a blanket is placed under the casualty (as described earlier).  
2. If poles of good length and rigidity are available, roll the blanket over the poles until 
the poles are pressed to the sides of the casualty. 
If poles are not available, the blanket itself is rolled up tightly to the sides of the 
casualty. 
3. If necessary, broad bandages are places around the body, one at the level of the 
thigh, another at the level of the shoulders.  
4. Lift the casualty and place the stretcher exactly under the casualty. 
5. In case of potential injuries to head, neck, spine or legs, two bearers should support 
the neck and ankle. 
6. Lower the casualty on the stretcher. 
7. Secure the casualty on the stretcher. 
O.5.1.2 
EMERGENCY LIFT 
 
1. If no blanket is available, the following method is used: Open the casualty’s coat or 
bush-coat and roll the free ends firmly close up to the side of the casualty’s body. 
2. Lift the casualty and put him on the stretcher as described above. 
 
 


  
327 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.5.2 
LIFTING AND LOWERING A STRETCHER 
 
1. At the command “Lower Stretcher", the two or four bearers will stoop, gently lower 
the stretcher to the ground and rise together. 
2. At the command “Lift Stretcher", they will then rise steadily together keeping the 
stretcher level.  
O.5.3 
CARRYING A LOADED STRETCHER 
                              
 
Depending on the availability of manpower one can decide whether the stretcher is to be 
carried by four or two persons. 
In case of four helpers, each helper takes one handle of the stretcher and walks on the outside 
of the stretcher. 
In case of two helpers carrying, one helper takes the head side, the other the opposite side. 
They are positioned between the handles and take the both handles to hold the stretcher. 
They may decide to use a sling well over their shoulders and on the handles of the stretcher to 
help them to carry the stretcher. 
O.5.4 
LOADING A STRETCHER INTO AN AMBULANCE 
The stretcher is lowered with its head one pace from the door of the ambulance. The casualty 
will be loaded head first. While loading, take side pace to the ambulance raising the stretcher 
evenly to the level of the berth to be loaded. The front bearers place the runners in the grooves 


  
328 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
and then assist the rear bearers to slide the stretcher into its place and secure it. If slings have 
been used these should be kept with their stretcher. 
 
 


  
329 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
O.6 
MOVING AND TRANSPORTING A CASUALTY SUSPECTED OF A HEAD, NECK 
OR SPINAL INJURY 
To prevent further injury, a casualty with a suspected head, neck or spinal injury shall be 
handled with the greatest care. 
To transport a casualty suspected of a head, neck or spinal injury: 
1. Prepare the stretcher; the soft bed of the canvas type of stretcher must be stiffened, 
preferably by placing short boards across the stretchers, or long ones lengthwise on 
the canvas if only these are available. If no stretcher is available, a narrow shutter, 
door or board of at least the same width and length as the patient may be used. 
2. Cover the stretcher with a folded blanket and then blanket the stretcher. 
Place pillows or pads in readiness on the stretcher in a position to support the neck, 
and small part of the back. Those should be sufficiently large, but not too large, to 
preserve the normal curves of the spine. 
3. Whenever the casualty is to be moved or lifted he must not be bent, twisted or over 
extended. One bearer must apply firm but gentle support to the head and face, 
so as to prevent neck movement and another bearer must steady and support the 
lower limbs to prevent trunk movement. This must be continued until the casualty 
has been placed on the stretcher. 
4. When the casualty is not already lying on a blanket or rug. 
a. Place the blanket or rug on the ground in line with the casualty, and rolled 
lengthwise for half its width. 
b. While the two bearers maintain control of the head and lower limbs, other 
bearers very carefully turn the casualty on to his side every precaution being 
taken against movement at the site of the # FRACTURE fracture. Place the roller portion of 
the blanket or rug close to the casualty's back and gently rolls him over the roll 
until he is lying on his opposite side. Unroll the rolled portion of the blanket or 
rug gently lowering the casualty on his back so that he lies on the centre of the 
open blanket or rug. The bearers at the head and at the lower limbs conform 
to the rolling of the casualty throughout. 
5. Loading the stretcher.  
There are two methods of loading a stretcher- a standard method (when there is a 
blanket under the casualty), and an emergency method (when there is no blanket 
under the casualty), in which case the stretcher can be pushed under the casualty 
for that it will be necessary for the bearer at the feet to keep his legs wide apart to 
allow the stretcher to be placed between them. 
a. “Blanket lift” is the standard method for loading cases of # FRACTURE fractures of the spine 
when there is blanket under the casualty. 
Roll the two edges of the blanket up against the casualty's side.  
If poles of sufficient length and rigidity are available the edges of the blanket 
should be rolled around them. This will make the lifting of the casualty very 
much easier. 


  
330 
TITLE OF CHAPTER
While two bearers maintain support of the head and lower limbs, the remaining 
bearers distribute themselves as required on each side of the casualty facing 
one another.  
On the word of command they raise him by grasping the rolled edges of the 
blanket and, acting together, carefully and evenly lift him to a sufficient height 
to enable the stretcher to be pushed underneath him.  
If this is for any reason impossible the stretcher should be brought as near to the 
casualty as circumstances permit and the bearers should move short even side 
paces until the casualty is directly over the stretcher, when he should be gently 
and cautiously lowered onto it. 
Ensure that the pads are in the correct position. 
b. The “Emergency method” for loading # FRACTURE fractures of the spine is used when there 
is no blanket under the casualty and none is available. 
Open out the casualty jacket and roll it firmly so that the rolls are close to each 
side.  
Place the casualty on the stretcher adopting the same procedure as described 
for the blanket lift method except that the bearers grasp the rolled up jacket 
and/or the clothing and /or bandage round the casualty's thighs instead of the 
rolled edges of the blanket. When the clothing is insecure, a broad bandage 
must be placed round the body just below the shoulder for the bearers to 
grasp. 
6. In the case of cervical injuries, place firm supports such as rolled-up blankets or 
sandbags on each side of the head to steady it. 
7. Place a folded blanket in the hollow above the heels so as to relieve pressure on 
them. 
8. Wrap the casualty. 
9. If he is to be carried over rough ground, reduce his body movements to a minimum 
by binding him firmly but not too tightly to the stretcher, with broad bandages. 
These should be applied round the pelvis, thighs and calves, and round the body 
and arms, just above the elbows. 
10. On reaching the shelter, medical facility or hospital, do nothing further until the 
arrival of medical aid.  
11. The above method of transportation of spinal injury case is to be used only if hard 
board is not available. 
O.6.1.1 
TRANSPORTING UNCONSCIOUS VICTIMS 
After giving emergency first aid, the victim is to be placed on a large hardboard or inverted 
“charpai'. Secure him on the board and strap him. The head of the victim is to be secured 
tightly. 
Breathing # UNCONSCIOUS unconscious victims are to be placed in the recovery position and transported in that 
position. They should be observed continuously. If they stop breathing, they should be turned 
back on their back and CPR is to be started. 
Unconscious non-breathing casualties are transported whilst lying on their back and whilst CPR 
is continued to be applied.
